            INTRODUCTION<br>
            This is the third part of our

            <b>Circuits</b>
            e-book
            series. It contains a
            further 100 circuits. This time we have concentrated on circuits
            containing one or more IC's. <br>
            It's amazing what you can do with transistors but when Integrated
            Circuits came along, the whole field of electronics exploded. <br>
            IC's can handle both analogue as well as digital signals but before
            their arrival, nearly all circuits were analogue or very simple
            "digital" switching circuits.<br>
            Let's explain what we mean. <br>
            The word analogue is a waveform or signal that is changing
            (increasing and decreasing) at a constant or non constant rate. Examples
            are voice, music, tones, sounds and frequencies. Equipment such as
            radios, TV's and amplifiers process analogue signals. <br>
            Then digital came along. <br>
            Digital is similar to a switch turning something on and off. <br>
            The advantage of digital is two-fold. <br>
            Firstly it is a very reliable and accurate way to send a signal. The
            signal is either HIGH or LOW&nbsp; (ON or OFF). It cannot be half-on or
            one quarter-off. <br>
            And secondly, a circuit that is ON, consumes the least amount of energy
            in the controlling device. In other words, a transistor that is fully
            turned ON and driving a motor, dissipates the least amount of heat. If
            it is slightly turned ON or nearly fully turned ON, it gets very hot.
            <br>
            And obviously a transistor that is not turned on at all will consume no
            energy. <br>
            A transistor that turns ON fully and OFF fully is called a SWITCH. <br>
            When two transistors are cross-coupled in the form of a flip flop, any
            pulses entering the circuit cause it to flip and flop and the output
            goes HIGH on every second pulse. This means the circuit halves the input
            pulses and is the basis of counting or dividing. It is also the basis of
            a "Memory Cell" as will will hold a piece of information.<br>
            Digital circuits also introduce the concept of two inputs creating a
            HIGH output when both are HIGH and variations of this. <br>
            This is called "logic" and introduces terms such as "Boolean algebra"
            (Boolean logic) and "gates." <br>
            Integrated Circuits started with a few transistors in each "chip" and
            increased to mini or micro computers in a single chip. These chips
            are called Microcontrollers and a single chip with a few surrounding
            components can be programmed to play games, monitor heart-rate and do
            all sorts of amazing things. Because they can process information at
            high speed, the end result can appear to have intelligence and this is
            where we are heading: <b>AI</b> (Artificial Intelligence). <br>
            <br>
            In this <b>IC Circuits ebook</b>, we have presented about 100 interesting
            circuits using Integrated Circuits. <br>
            In most cases the IC will contain 10 - 100 transistors, cost less than
            the individual components and take up much less board-space. They also
            save a lot of circuit designing and quite often consume less current
            than discrete components or the components they replace. <br>
            In all, they are a fantastic way to get something working with the least
            componentry. <br>
            A list of of some of the most common Integrated Circuits (Chips) is provided at the end of this
            book to help you identify the pins and show you what is inside the chip.
            <br>
            Some of the circuits are available from Talking Electronics as a kit,
            but others will have to be purchased as individual components from your
            local electronics store.
            Electronics is such an enormous field that we cannot provide kits for
            everything. But if you have a query about one of the circuits, you can
            contact me.<br>

              To save space we have not provided lengthy explanations of how the
              circuits work. This has already been covered in TALKING ELECTRONICS
              Basic Electronics Course, and can be obtained on a

              MORE INTRO
              <br>
              <br>
              We have said this before abut we will say it again: <b>There are two ways to learn electronics.
              </b> <br>
              One is to go to school and study theory for 4 years and come out with
              all the theoretical knowledge in the world but very little practical
              experience. The other is to "learn on the job."<br>
              I am not saying one approach is better than the other but most electronics
              enthusiasts are not "book worms" and many have been dissuaded
              from entering electronics due to the complex mathematics surrounding
              University-type courses. <br>
              Our method is to get around this by advocating designing, building,
              constructions and even more assembly with lots of experimenting and when
              you get stuck with a mathematical problem, get some advice or read about
              it via the thousands of free test books on the web. <br>
              Anyone can succeed in this field by
              applying themselves to constructing
              projects. You actually learn 10 times faster by doing it yourself and we
              have had lots of examples of designs from students in the early stages
              of their career. <br>
              And don't think the experts get it right the first time. Look at all the
              recalled electronics equipment from the early days.<br>
              The most amazing inventions have come from almost "newcomers" as
              evidenced by looking through the "New Inventions" website. <br>
              All you have to do is see a path for your ideas and have a goal that you
              can add your ideas to the "Word of Invention" and you succeed.<br>
              Nothing succeeds like success. And if you have a flair for designing
              things, electronics will provide you a comfortable living for the rest of your
              life. <br>
              The market is very&nbsp; narrow
              but new designs are coming along all the time and new devices
              are constantly being invented and more are always needed. <br>
              Once you get past this eBook of "Chips" you will want to
              investigate microcontrollers and this is when your options will explode.
              <br>
              You will be able to carry out tasks you never thought possible, with a
              chip as small as 8 pins and a few hundred lines of code. <br>
              In two weeks you can start to understand the programming code for a
              microcontroller and perform simple tasks such as flashing a LED and
              produce sounds and outputs via the press of a button. <br>
              All these things are covered on
              <a href="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/">Talking Electronics website</a>
              and you don't have to buy any books or publications. Everything is
              available on the web and it is instantly accessible. That's the beauty
              of the web. <br>
              Don't think things are greener on the other side of the fence, by buying
              a text book. They aren't. Everything you need is on the web AT NO COST.
              <br>
              The only thing you have to do is build things. If you have any
              technical problem at all, simply email
              <a href="mailto:talking@tpg.com.au?subject=Ask Colin Mitchell any technical question">
                Colin Mitchell</a> and any question will be answered. Nothing could be
              simpler and this way we guarantee you SUCCESS. Hundreds of readers have
              already emailed and after 5 or more emails, their circuit works. That's
              the way we work. One thing at a time and eventually the fault is found.
              <br>
              If you think a circuit will work the first time it is turned on, you are
              fooling yourself. <br>
              All circuits need corrections and improvements and that's what makes a
              good electronics person.&nbsp;Don't give up. How do you think all
              the circuits in these eBooks were designed?
              Some were copied and some were designed from scratch but all had to be
              built and adjusted slightly to make sure they&nbsp; worked perfectly.
              <br>
              I don't care if you use bread-board, copper strips, matrix board or
              solder the components in the air as a "bird's nest."&nbsp; You only learn when the
              circuit gets turned on and WORKS!<br>
              In fact the rougher you build something, the more you will guarantee it will
              work when built on a printed circuit board. <br>
              However, high-frequency circuits (such as 100MHz&nbsp; FM Bugs) do not
              like open layouts and you have to keep the construction as tight as
              possible to get them to operate reliably. <br>
              In most other cases, the layout is not critical. <br>
              If you just follow these ideas, you will succeed. <br>
              <br>
              A few of the basics are also provided in this eBook, the first is
              transistor outlines:<br>
              <br>

              <b>TRANSISTORS<br>
              </b>
              Most of the transistors
              used in our circuits are BC 547 and BC 557. These are classified as
              "universal" or "common" NPN and PNP types with a voltage rating of about
              25v, 100mA collector current and a gain of about 100. <br>
              You can use almost any type of transistor to replace them and here is a list of
              the equivalents and pinouts:<br>

              THE 555
            </b>
            <b><br>
            </b>
            The 555 is everywhere. It is possibly
            the most-frequency used chip and is easy to use. <br>
            But if you want to use it in a "one-shot" or similar circuit, you
            need to know how the chip will "sit." <br>
            For this you need to know about the UPPER THRESHOLD&nbsp; (pin 6)
            and LOWER THRESHOLD (pin 2):<br>
            The 555 is fully covered in a 3 page article on Talking Electronics website (see left index:
            555 P1 P2 P3) <br>
            <br>
            Here is the pin identification for each pin:<br>
            <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/555Pinout-1.gif" width="275" height="130" border="0"><img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/555Iso.gif"
              width="156" height="140" border="0"><br>
            When drawing a circuit diagram, always draw the 555 as a building
            block with the pins in the following locations. This will help you
            instantly recognise the
            function of each pin:

            <br>

            Note: Pin 7 is "in phase" with
            output
            Pin 3 (both are low at the same time).<br>
            Pin 7 "shorts" to 0v via the transistor. It is pulled HIGH via R1.
            <br>
            Maximum supply voltage 16v - 18v<br>
            Current consumption approx 10mA<br>

            <br>
            <b>Faults with Chip:</b><br>
            Consumes about 10mA when sitting in circuit<br>
            Output voltage up to 2.5v <b>less than rail voltage <br>
              Output is 0.5v to 1.5v above ground</b><br>
            Sources up to 200mA but sinks only 50mA<br>
            <br>

            <b>HOW TO USE THE 555</b>
            <br>
            There are many ways to use the 55. <br>
            (a) Astable Multivibrator&nbsp; - constantly oscillates <br>
            (b) Monostable&nbsp; - changes state only once per trigger pulse -
            also called a ONE SHOT<br>
            (c) Voltage Controlled Oscillator
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR
              <br>
            </b>
            The output frequency of a 555
            can be worked out from the following graph:<br>

            The graph applies to the following Astable circuit:

                    The capacitor C charges via
                    R1 and R2 and when the voltage on the capacitor reaches 2/3
                    of the supply, pin 6 detects this and pin 7 connects to 0v.
                    The capacitor discharges through R2 until its voltage is 1/3
                    of the supply and pin 2 detects this and turns off pin7 to
                    repeat the cycle. <br>
                    The top resistor is included to prevent pin 7 being damaged
                    as it shorts to 0v when pin 6 detects 2/3 rail voltage. <br>
                    Its resistance is small compared to R2 and does not come
                    into the timing of the oscillator.

              Using the graph:</b><br>
            Suppose R1 = 1k, R2 = 10k and C = 0.1 (100n).<br>
            Using the formula on the graph, the total resistance&nbsp; = 1 + 10 + 10 = 21k <br>
            The scales on the graph are logarithmic so that 21k is approximately
            near the "1" on the 10k. Draw a line parallel to the lines on the
            graph and where it crosses the 0.1u line, is the answer. The result
            is approx 900Hz. <br>
            <br>
            Suppose R1 = 10k, R2 = 100k and C = 1u<br>
            Using the formula on the graph, the total resistance&nbsp; = 10 + 100 + 100 = 210k <br>
            The scales on the graph are logarithmic so that 210k is approximately
            near the first "0" on the 100k. Draw a line parallel to the lines on the
            graph and where it crosses the 1u line, is the answer. The result
            is approx 9Hz. <br>

                    If the capacitor is replaced with an electrolytic, the frequency of
                    oscillation will reduce. When the frequency is less than 1Hz, the
                    oscillator circuit is called a timer or "delay circuit." The 555
                    will produce delays as long as 30 minutes but with long delays, the
                    timing is not accurate.<br>

            This very clever circuit only produces an output when the piezo

            for details.&nbsp; <br>
            The circuit takes only a few microamp and when a tap is detected by
            the piezo, the waveform from the transistor produces a HIGH on pin 6
            and the HIGH on pin 5 makes output pin 4 go low. This very quickly
            charges the 47n and it is discharged via the 560k to produce a brief
            pulse at pin 3. <br>
            The 47n is mainly to stop noise entering pin 2. Pin 1 is HIGH via
            the 2M7 and the LOW on pin 2 causes pin 3 to produce a HIGH pulse.
            The 47n is discharged via the internal diodes on pin 13 and when it
            goes LOW, pin 11 goes HIGH and charges the 10n via the 22k and
            diode. <br>
            This puts a HIGH on pin 8 for approx 0.7 seconds and when a second
            tap is detected, pin 9 sees a HIGH and pin 10 goes LOW. This puts a
            LOW on pin 12 and a HIGH on pin 8. The LOW on pin 12 goes to pin 1.
            A HIGH and LOW on the second NAND gate produces a HIGH on pin 3 and
            the third NAND gate has a HIGH on both inputs. This makes pin 10 LOW
            and the 4u7 starts to charge via the 2M7 resistor. After 5 seconds
            pin 12 sees a HIGH and pin 11 goes LOW. The 10n is discharged via
            the 10M and when pin 8 sees a LOW, pin 10 goes HIGH. The output sits
            HIGH and goes LOW for about 7 seconds.

              The game consists
              of six LEDs and an indicator LED that flashes at a rate of about 2
              cycles per second. A push button is the "Operations Control" and by
              carefully pushing the button in synchronisation with the flashing
              LED, the row of LEDs will gradually light up.<br>
              But the slightest mistake will immediately extinguish one, two or
              three LEDs. The aim of the game is to illuminate the 6 LEDs with the
              least number of pushes. <br>
              We have sold thousands of these kits. It's a great challenge.

              BFO METAL DETECTOR
            </b>
            <br>



            The circuit shown must represent the limits of simplicity for a
            metal detector. It uses a single 4093 quad Schmitt NAND IC and a
            search coil -- and of course a switch and batteries. A lead from
            IC1d pin 11 needs to be attached to a MW radio aerial, or should be
            wrapped around the radio. If the radio has a BFO switch, switch this
            ON.<br>
            <br>
            Since an inductor resists rapid changes in voltage (called
            reactance), any change in the logic level at IC1c pin 10 is delayed
            during transfer back to input pins 1 and 2. This is further delayed
            through propagation delays within the 4093 IC. This sets up a rapid
            oscillation (about 2 MHz), which is picked up by a MW radio. Any
            change to the inductance of L1 (through the presence of metal)
            brings about a change to the oscillator frequency. Although 2 MHz is
            out of range of the Medium Waves, a MW radio will clearly pick up
            harmonics of this frequency.<br>
            <br>
            The winding of the coil is by no means critical, and a great deal of
            latitude is permissible. The prototype used 50 turns of 22 awg/30
            swg (0.315 mm) enamelled copper wire, wound on a 4.7"/120 mm former.
            This was then wrapped in insulation tape. The coil then requires a
            Faraday shield, which is connected to 0V. A Faraday shield is a
            wrapping of tin foil around the coil, leaving a small gap so that
            the foil does not complete the entire circumference of the coil. The
            Faraday shield is again wrapped in insulation tape. A connection may
            be made to the Faraday shield by wrapping a bare piece of stiff wire
            around it before adding the tape. Ideally, the search coil will be
            wired to the circuit by means of twin-core or figure-8 microphone
            cable, with the screen being wired to the Faraday shield.<br>
            <br>
            The metal detector is set up by tuning the MW radio to pick up a
            whistle (a harmonic of 2 MHz). Note that not every such harmonic
            works best, and the most suitable one needs to be found. The
            presence of metal will then clearly change the tone of the whistle.
            The metal detector has excellent stability, and it should detect a
            large coin at 80 to 90 mm, which for a BFO detector is relatively
            good. It will also discriminate between ferrous and non-ferrous
            metals through a rise or fall in tone.<br>

            <b>SIMPLE BFO METAL LOCATOR<br>
            </b>
            This circuit uses a single
            coil and nine components to make a particularly sensitive low-cost
            metal locator. It works on the principle of a beat frequency
            oscillator (BFO).<br>
            The circuit incorporates two oscillators, both operating at about
            40kHz. The first, IC1a, is a standard CMOS oscillator with its
            frequency adjustable via VR1.<br>
            The frequency of the second, IC1b, is highly dependent on the
            inductance of coil L1, so that its frequency shifts in the presence
            of metal. L1 is 70 turns of 0.315mm enamelled copper wire wound on a
            120mm diameter former. The Faraday shield is made of aluminum foil,
            which is wound around all but about 10mm of the coil and connected
            to pin 4 of IC1b.<br>
            The two oscillator signals are mixed through IC1c, to create a beat
            note. IC1d and IC1c drive the piezo sounder in push-pull fashion,
            thereby boosting the output.<br>
            Unlike many other metal locators of its kind, this locator is
            particularly easy to tune. Around the midpoint setting of VR1, there
            will be a loud beat frequency with a null point in the middle. The
            locator needs to be tuned to a low frequency beat note to one or the
            other side of this null point.<br>
            Depending on which side is chosen, it will be sensitive to either
            ferrous or non-ferrous metals. Besides detecting objects under the
            ground, the circuit could serve well as a pipe locator.

              1.5v to 5v PHONE CHARGER<br>
            </b>
            Look at the photos. The circuit is simple. It
            looks like two surface-mount transistors, an inductor, diode,
            capacitor, resistor and LED. <br>
            But you will be mistaken. <br>
            One of the "transistors" is a controller and the other is a
            FET. <br>
            The controller is powered from the output (5v) of the circuit
            and when it detects no-load, it shuts down and requires a very small
            current.&nbsp; <br>
            When the 1v5 batter is connected, the controller starts up at less than
            1v5 due to the Schottkey diode and charges the 1u capacitor by
            driving the FET and using the flyback effect of the inductor to
            produce a high voltage. When the output voltage is 5v, the controller
            turns off and the only load on the 1u is the controller. When
            the voltage drops across this capacitor, the controller turns on in bursts to keep the 1u charged
            to
            exactly 5v. The charger was purchased for $3.00 so it is cheaper to
            buy one and use it in your own project. It also comes
            with 4 adapter leads!

                      Sometimes it is better to use
                      something that is already available, rather than trying to
                      re-invent the wheel. This is certainly the case with this
                      project. You could not buy the components for the cost of

              10 SECOND ALARM <br>
            </b>
            This circuit is activated
            for 10 seconds via the first two gates. They form a LATCH to keep
            the oscillator (made up of the next two gates) in operation, to
            drive the speaker. <br>
            The circuit consumes a few microamps in quiescent mode and the TOUCH
            PLATES can be any type of foil on a door knob or item that is
            required to be protected. The 10u sits in an uncharged condition and
            when the plates are touched, the voltage on pin 1 drops below 50%
            rail and makes pin 3 HIGH. This pulls pins 5 and 6 HIGH and makes
            pin 4 LOW. This keeps pin 3 HIGH, no matter if a HIGH or LOW is on
            pin1. This turns on the oscillator and the 10u starts to charge via
            the 100k resistor. After about 10 seconds, the voltage on pins 5 and
            6 drops to below 50% rail voltage and pin 4 goes HIGH. If the TOUCH
            PLATES are not touched,&nbsp; pin 3 will go LOW and the oscillator
            will stop.&nbsp;

              USING A VOLTAGE REGULATOR<br>

            </b>
            This circuit shows how to use a
            voltage regulator to convert a 24v supply to 12v for a 555 chip. Note:
            the pins on the regulator (commonly called a 3-terminal regulator) are:
            IN, COMMON, OUT and these must match-up with: In, Common, Out on the
            circuit diagram. <br>
            If the current requirement is less than 500mA, a 100R "safety resistor"
            can be placed on the 24v rail to prevent spikes damaging the regulator. <br>

              This circuit uses a single
              transistor and LM386 amplifier IC to produce an intercom that
              allows hands-free operation. <br>
              As both microphones and loudspeakers are always connected, the
              circuit is designed to avoid feedback - known as the "Larsen
              effect".<br>
              The microphone amplifier transistor is 180° phase-shifted and
              one of the audio outputs is taken at the collector and its
              in-phase output taken at the emitter. These are mixed by the
              10u, 22u, 20k pot and 2k7 so that the two signals almost cancel
              out. In this way, the loudspeaker will reproduce a very faint
              copy of the signals picked-up by the microphone.<br>
              At the same time, as both collectors of the two intercom units
              are tied together, the 180° phase-shifted signal will pass to
              the audio amplifier of the second unit without attenuation, so
              it will be loudly reproduced by its loudspeaker.<br>
              The same operation will occur when speaking into the microphone
              of the second unit. When the 20k pot is set correctly, almost no
              output will be heard from the loudspeaker but a loud and clear
              reproduction will be heard at the output of the other unit.
              The second 20k pot adjusts the volume.

              This circuit
              connects to a phone line. When the phone rings for 3 or 4 rings, the
              relay is activated for about 1 minute.&nbsp; But if the phone
              rings for 6 or more rings, the circuit is not activated. <br>
              The circuit takes less than 100uA when in quiescent state and
              when the phone rings, the ring voltage is passed to pin 1 via
              the 100k and 100n capacitor. This causes pin 2 to go HIGH and
              charge two 100u electrolytics. The lower 100u charges in 7
              seconds and the upper charges in 12 seconds. If the phone
              rings for only 3 rings, pin 4 goes LOW and charges the third
              100u via a 47k resistor. After a further 7 seconds, pin 10 goes
              HIGH. If the phone stops ringing after 3 rings, the lower 100u
              starts to discharge via the 470k and after about 40 seconds pin
              4 goes HIGH. The third 100u now starts to discharge via the 470k
              across it and the relay turns off. <br>
              If the phone rings for more than 5 rings, the top 100u will
              charge and pin 6 will go LOW and cause pin 8 to go HIGH and
              prevent pin 11 going LOW via the gating diode.

              This circuit provides automatic level control of a water
              tank.<br>
              The shorter steel rod is the "water high" sensor and the
              longer is the "water low" sensor. When the water level is below
              both sensors, pin 10 is low. If the water comes
              in contact with the longer sensor the output remains low until
              the shorter sensor is reached. At this point pin11 goes
              high and the transistor conducts. The relay is energized and the pump starts
              operating.
              When the water level drops the shorter sensor
              will be no longer in contact with the water, but the output of
              the IC will keep the transistor tuned ON until the water falls
              below the level of the longer rod. When the water level falls
              below the longer sensor, the output of the IC goes low and the pump will
              stop.
              <br>
              The switch provides reverse operation.
              Switching to connect the transistor to pin 11 of&nbsp;the IC
              will cause the
              pump will operate when the tank is nearly empty and will
              stop when the tank is full. In this case, the pump will be
              used to fill the tank and not to empty it.<br>
              Note:

              The two steel rods must be supported by a small
              insulated (wooden or plastic) board.
              The circuit can be used also with non-metal tanks,
              provided a third steel rod having about the same height as
              the tank is connected to the
              negative.

              <br>
              Adding an alarm to pin 11 will let you know the tank is nearly
              empty.

            <div id="maincontent4">
              Here's a project with an interesting
              name. The original design was bought over 40 years ago, before
              the introduction of the electret microphone. They used a crystal
              earpiece. <br>
              We have substituted it with a piezo diaphragm and used a quad
              op-amp to produce two building blocks. The first is a high-gain
              amplifier to take the few millivolts output of the piezo and
              amplify it sufficiently to drive the input of a counter chip.
              This requires a waveform of at least 6v for a 9v supply and we
              need a gain of about 600. <br>
              The other building block is simply a buffer that takes the
              high-amplitude waveform and delivers the negative excursions to
              a reservoir capacitor (100u electrolytic). The charge on this
              capacitor turns on a BC557 transistor and this effectively takes
              the power pin of the counter-chip to the positive rail via the
              collector lead.<br>
              The chip has internal current limiting and some of the outputs
              are taken to sets of three LEDs.&nbsp; <br>
              The chip is actually a counter or divider and the frequency
              picked up by the piezo is divided by 128 and delivered to one
              output and
              divided by over 8,000 by the highest-division output to three
              more LEDs The other lines have lower divisions. <br>
              This creates a very impressive effect as the LEDs are connected
              to produce a balanced display that changes according to the beat
              of the music. <br>
              The voltage on the three amplifiers is determined by the 3M3 and
              1M voltage-divider on the first op-amp. It produces about 2v.
              This makes the output go HIGH and it takes pin 2 with it until
              this pin see a few millivolts above pin3. At this point the
              output stops rising. <br>
              Any waveform (voltage) produced by the piezo that is lower than
              the voltage on pin 3 will make the output go HIGH and this is
              how we get a large waveform. <br>
              This signal is passed to the second op-amp and because the
              voltage on pin 6 is delayed slightly by the 100n capacitor, is
              also produces a gain. <br>
              When no signal is picked up by the piezo, pin 7 is approx 2v and
              pin 10 is about 4.5v.&nbsp; Because pin 9 is lower than pin 10,
              the output pin 8 is about 7.7v (1.3v below the supply rail) as
              this is as high as the output will go - it does not go full
              rail-to-rail. <br>
              The LED connected to the output removes 1.7v, plus 0.6v between
              base and emitter and this means the transistor is not turned on.&nbsp;
              <br>
              Any colour LEDs can be used and a mixture will give a different
              effect. <br>

              Here's an interesting circuit that
              creates a clock pulse for a 4017 from a flashing LED. The
              flashing LED takes almost no current between flashes and thus
              the clock line is low via the 1k to 22k resistor. When the LED
              flashes, the voltage on the clock line is about 2v -3v below the
              rail voltage (depending on the value of the resistor) and this
              is sufficient for the chip to see a HIGH. <br>

              WHEEL OF FORTUNE

            <br>
            Here's a circuit from Vellemann. <br>
            The slow-down circuit consists of the top three gates, R3, D1, C2,
            R4 and C3. <br>
            Sw1 is pressed for a brief period. <br>
            This charges the 47u and the 1u is charged via the 100k. <br>
            The voltage on the 1u rises until it puts a HIGH on input pin 11.<br>
            This puts a LOW on pin 2 and the voltage on the 1u drops until the
            voltage on pin 11 is a LOW. <br>
            The voltage fluctuates at about half rail voltage as it puts a HIGH
            and LOW on Pin 11. It is charged by the 100k and discharged by the
            10 and diode.<br>
            The HIGH on pin 2 allows the 1u to charge via the 100k and this
            gradually reduces the voltage on the 47u. <br>
            As the voltage on the 47u falls, the time taken to charge the 1u
            increases and creates the slow-down effect. Eventually the voltage on
            the 1u is not enough to put a HIGH on Pin 11 and the circuit
            freezes.

              three terminals of circuit 1 (below, left) and a red LED will
              detect the base of a PNP transistor an a green LED will indicate

              and when you have fitted the collector and emitter leads
              correctly (maybe have to swap leads), the red or green LED will
              come on to prove you have fitted the transistor correctly. <br>
              <b>Test 3</b>: The transistor can now be fitted in the GAIN

            The output has an active buzzer that produces a beep when the

            active buzzer containing components. It is called an
            electro-mechanical buzzer as it has two coils. The main coil pulls
            the diaphragm to the core via a transistor and the feedback coil
            drives the base. When the transistor is fully saturated, the
            feedback winding does not see any induced voltage (and current) and
            the transistor turns OFF. The rapid action of this oscillator

              LONG DURATION TIMER
            </b>
            <div id="maincontent12">

              To get a long duration timer we can create an oscillator, called
              a CLOCK OSCILLATOR, and feed it to a number of flip-flops. A
              flip-flop is a form of bi-stable multivibrator, wired so
              an input signal will change the output on every second
              cycle. In other words it divides (halves) the input signal. When
              two of these are connected in a "chain" the input signal
              divides by 4. The CD4060 IC has 14 stages. These are also called
              BINARY DIVIDERS and the chip is also called a COUNTER.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              The IC also has components (called gates or inverters) on pins
              9,10 and 11 that can
              be wired to produce an oscillator. Three external components are
              needed to produce the duration of the oscillations. In other
              words the frequency of the "clock signal."<br>
              The output of the oscillator is connected (inside the chip) to
              the Binary Dividers and each stage goes HIGH then LOW due to the
              signal it is receiving. Each stage rises and falls at a rate
              that is half the previous stage and the final stage provides the
              long time delay as it takes 2<sup>13</sup> clock cycles before
              going HIGH. We have only taken from Q10 in this circuit and the outline of the chip has been provided in
              the
              circuit so different outputs can be used to produce different
              timings. <br>
              The diode on the output "jams" the oscillator and stops it
              operating so the relay stays active when the time has expired. <br>

                      signals such as audio but can also reproduce

            This circuit shows how a very complex set of pulses can be
            produced via a very simple circuit. <br>
            The CD4060B IC produce three kinds of pulses. Preset VR1 is
            fine-tuned to get 0.3125Hz pulses at pin 3 of IC1. At the same
            time, pulses obtainable from pin 1 will be of 1.25 Hz and 20 Hz
            at pin 14. The three output pins of IC1 are connected to base
            terminals of transistors T1, T2, and T3 through resistors R1,
            R2, and R3, respectively.<br>
            &nbsp;Working with a built-in oscillator-type piezo buzzer generates
            about 1kHz tone. In this particular circuit, the piezo-buzzer is
            turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ at 20 Hz for ring tone sound by transistor
            T3. 20Hz pulses are obtainable at the collector of transistor T3
            for 0.4-second duration. Just after a time interval of 0.4
            second, 20Hz pulses become again obtainable for another
            0.4-second duration. This is followed by two seconds of no sound
            interval. Thereafter the pulse pattern repeats by itself.

              KNIGHT RIDER<br>

            </b>
            In the <b>Knight
              Rider</b> circuit, the 555 is wired as an oscillator. It can be adjusted
            to give the desired speed for the display. The output of the 555 is
            directly connected to the input of a Johnson Counter (CD 4017). The
            input of the counter is called the CLOCK line.&nbsp;<br>
            The 10 outputs Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>9</sub> become active, one at a
            time, on the rising edge of the waveform from the 555.&nbsp;Each output can
            deliver about 20mA but a LED should not be connected to the output
            without a current-limiting resistor (330R in the circuit above).&nbsp;<br>
            The first 6 outputs of the chip are connected directly to the 6 LEDs and
            these "move" across the display. The next 4 outputs move the effect in
            the opposite direction and the cycle repeats. The animation above shows
            how the effect appears on the display.&nbsp;<br>
            Using six 3mm LEDs, the display can be placed in the front of a model
            car to give a very realistic effect. The same outputs can be taken to
            driver transistors to produce a larger version of the display.<b>

            the value of the first 10u and 47k. <br>
            When the first 555 IC turns off, the 100n is uncharged because both ends
            are at rail voltage and it pulses pin 2 of the middle 555 LOW. This
            activates the 555 and pin 3 goes HIGH. This pin supplies rail voltage to
            the third 555 and the two red LEDs are alternately flashed. When the
            train passes the CANCEL reed switch, pin 4 of the middle 555 is taken
            LOW and the red LEDs stop flashing.<br>

              20mA CONSTANT-CURRENT GENERATOR
            </b>

            <br>
            This circuit produces a constant 20mA current with an output voltage
            approx 3v lower than the battery voltage. <br>
            It uses an LM317 adjustable regulator which has a voltage-drop of
            about 3v between the IN and OUT terminals. If the battery voltage is 12v, the
            circuit will deliver about 9v at 20mA. The regulator has an internal
            voltage reference of 1.25v between OUT and ADJUST pins and when a
            resistor is placed between the OUT pin and the circuit being
            supplied, the current flowing through
            the resistor will produce a voltage-drop. As the current required by
            the circuit increases, the voltage across this resistor will
            increase. When it is
            1.25v, the current will be 20mA. If the current increases due to the output resistance
            decreasing, the voltage across the resistor increases and the LN317
            reduces the output voltage. This causes the current to reduce to
            20mA. This is how the circuit produces a constant current.&nbsp; <br>

              The single regulator in this circuit will provide a variable

              As soon as the current reaches the limit set by the 100R pot,
              the BC547 transistor starts to turn on and rob the regulator of
              voltage on the Adj pin. The output voltage starts to reduce. If

            <p class="left">The output of each gate will deliver about 10mA.
              This is sufficient to drive a LED, but if extra current is required,
              a transistor BUFFER will be needed. For up to 100mA, a BC547 can be
              used. For up to 4 amps a BD679 Darlington transistor can be used. </p>

              <b>Adding a BUFFER TRANSISTOR</b>
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Each gate is a separate "Building Block." It is basically an
              AMPLIFIER. It is a CURRENT AMPLIFIER and it is different to any other
              type of amplifier. Here is how it works:<br>
              When the input is LOW, the output is HIGH and will deliver 10mA to a
              load. When the input is HIGH the output is LOW and it will sink 10mA
              from a load that is connected to rail.&nbsp; <br>
              Here is the CURRENT AMPLIFYING part:&nbsp; It takes less than 1
              microamp on the input to make the output high or low.&nbsp; <br>
              Here's the second feature of the gate:<br>
              When the input is LOW (A LOW is from 0v to 25% of rail voltage), it
              can be increased slowly or up to a frequency of 4MHz, and when the
              voltage is 66% of rail voltage, the output immediately changes from
              HIGH to LOW. <br>
              When the input is HIGH (from 70% to 100% of rail voltage) and it
              decreases slowly or up to a frequency of 4MHz, the output
              immediately changes from LOW to HIGH when the voltage drops to 33%
              of rail voltage.&nbsp; <br>
              This produces a GAP between 33% and 66% called the HYSTERESIS GAP
              and it prevents noisy input voltages changing the output. The input
              voltage has to rise and/or fall about 33% of rail voltage for the
              output to change. <br>
              There are 6 of the gates in the IC and they are all internally wired
              to the power rails. You can think of the input as having infinite
              impedance (resistance), so it does not put a load on anything
              connected to this pin. <br>
              <br>
              Here is an animation of how the gate works. The input has to be
              above mid-rail for the output to change and below mid-rail for the
              output to change back to its originals state.

              The next feature to understand is called <strong>
                THE TIME DELAY CIRCUIT
              </strong><br>

              The time delay circuit is also
              know as a "<b>TIMING CIRCUIT</b>," "<b>DELAY CIRCUIT</b>," or "<b>R-C
                CIRCUIT</b>". These names all refer to a CAPACITOR and RESISTOR in
              series. It does not matter if the capacitor is placed above or below
              the resistor as the <b>time delay</b> will be the same. (The only
              difference will be the value of the voltage at the beginning and end
              of the timing cycle.)&nbsp;<br>
              The join of the two components is the point where the voltage is
              detected and is called the "<b>Detection Point</b>."&nbsp;<br>
              The Detection Point is monitored by a <b>Detection Circuit</b>. This
              will be the input of one of the Schmitt gates. &nbsp;<br>
              The detection circuit&nbsp; <b>must not load</b> the timing circuit. In
              other words the detection circuit must have a very high input
              impedance. That's the advantage of this IC.&nbsp; It is ideal for
              detecting the voltage on a DELAY CIRCUIT.&nbsp;<br>
              When voltage is applied to a TIMING CIRCUIT, the capacitor begins to
              charge. If we monitor the voltage across the capacitor, we can
              determine when it is at a particular voltage level. It will take a
              PERIOD OF TIME to reach this level and this is the TIME DELAY we
              require.&nbsp;<br>
              In the animation below we see the capacitor charging via a resistor,
              with a meter showing the approx voltage across the capacitor. The
              capacitor does not charge at a constant rate, but this
              characteristic does not concern us at the moment.&nbsp;<br>
              The point to remember is the TIME it takes for the capacitor to
              charge.&nbsp;
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="left">
              If we add the TIMING CIRCUIT (DELAY CIRCUIT) to the output of a Schmitt gate, we can
              see the capacitor charging and discharging:</p>
            <p class="center">

            <p class="left">
              <b>Here is the clever part</b>. Instead
              of the voltmeter monitoring the voltage across the capacitor, the
              input of the Schmitt Inverter can be connected to the capacitor.&nbsp;<br>
              If the voltage across the capacitor is less than 66% of rail
              voltage, the output of the gate is HIGH and the capacitor begins to
              charge. When the voltage reaches 67%, the output goes LOW and the
              capacitor begins to discharge. When the voltage across it reaches
              32% of rail voltage, the Schmitt Inverter changes state and the
              output goes HIGH.&nbsp;In this way we need only one gate to create an
              oscillator.<br>
              There are two very important things to observe in the animation
              below.<br>
              1. The output is a square wave. In other words the output goes from
              one state to the other <b>VERY QUICKLY</b>&nbsp; and this produces the
              characteristic square wave-shape.&nbsp;<br>
              2. The voltage across the capacitor is EXACTLY 32% to 67% of rail
              voltage.&nbsp;<br>
              The animation below shows the gate in operation.&nbsp;<br>
              You will notice that the diagram does not show the chip connected to
              the positive and negative rail. It is <b>ASSUMED</b> the chip is
              connected to the supply voltage and that's how the output produces
              the HIGH.&nbsp;

            </p>


            <p class="center">

                Fig B shows an electrolytic&nbsp; - low frequency oscillator</b>

            </p>





            <p class="left">

              An oscillator is created
              by placing a resistor from output to input and a capacitor from
              input to 0v.&nbsp; The output will be a square-wave and and the mark
              (high) will be equal to the space (low).<br>
              The frequency of the output will depend on the value of R and C.
              Values of 1k to 4M7 for R and 100p to 100u for C can be used. This
              is shown in circuits A and B above. <br>
              <br>
              If an unequal HIGH and LOW is required, a diode is placed between
              output and input:



            </p>

            <p class="center">
              <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/BasicOscBlocks-2.gif" width="300" height="175" border="1">
            </p>



            <p class="left">



              In figure C the output is output is
              low for a short period of time as the two resistors R1 and R2 are
              discharging the capacitor. If R2 is a very low value compared with
              R1 we can get the low duration to be 10% or less, of the HIGH. <br>
              In figure D the diode is reversed compared to figure C and output is
              high for a short period of time as the two resistors R1 and R2 are
              charging the capacitor. <br>
              <br>




              Here
              are some basic building blocks:

            <p class="left">
              <b>Delay </b>
              <br>
              In the diagram above, the <b>input line</b> goes HIGH and
              remains HIGH. It can be detecting a piece of equipment being turned
              on, for example. <br>
              This action charges capacitor <b>C</b> via resistor <b>R</b>. After
              a period of time (called the Delay Time), the input of the Schmitt
              Trigger reaches 67% of rail voltage and the output goes LOW.&nbsp; <br>
              The Delay Time is determined by the values of R and C. We are not
              concerned with the actual values of R and C at this point in time.
              They can be worked out by experimentation. <br>
              The point to note is the placement of the two components to produce a
              <b>DELAY</b>.&nbsp; <br>
              If the output is required to be the opposite of the circuit above,
              an inverter is added:

            </p>
            <p class="left">If a diode is added across the input resistor, the
              capacitor "C" will be discharged when the input goes low, so the

            <p class="left">When the

              discharging via the oscillator and it is "jammed" or "frozen" with
              the output LOW.

              The relay is energized for a short time, 2 minutes after the
              push-button is pressed. The push-button produces a brief LOW on pin
              1, no matter how long it is pushed and this produces a pulse of

              </b>

              <br>
              The alarm keeps wailing if the door
              is kept open. It only turns off after 5-10 minutes when the door is
              opened and closed. <br>
              The CD4093 is a <b>quad 2-input NAND gate</b> (with Schmitt Trigger
              input) and each is wired as
              an inverter in this circuit. The Schmitt Trigger feature of the
              input of each gate is not an essential feature in this circuit and
              you can also use a CD4011 <b>(quad 2-input NAND gate)</b> as it does
              not have the Schmitt Trigger feature - and may be easier to buy.<br>
              The first gate (pins 1, 2 and 3) is a timer and the output does not go HIGH
              until the 100u charges via the 470k. This is the Exit/Entry delay.
              When it goes HIGH, the two LEDs are turned ON via the 3k3 resistors.
              This arms the alarm. <br>
              Gate "<b>B</b>" (pins 5, 6 and 4) is an inverter that detects when the<b> Instant</b> input
              is broken and it charges the 100u via the 3k3 resistor. Gate "<b>C</b>"
              (pins 8, 9 and 10) detects the charge on the 100u and turns on the BC547 transistor via
              the 4k7 resistor. The <b>Instant</b> switch can be closed after a
              second as it has done its job of charging the top 100u via the 3k3
              resistor. The circuit is now activated and the siren starts wailing.
              The 100u and 4M7 provide the 5-10 minutes timer for the "wailing."<br>
              The 100u and 2M2 provide the timer for the buzzer
              when you enter. It will buzz for 20 seconds then turn off as the
              entry door has opened and closed and charged the lower 100u.The
              1N4148 only allows the circuit to charge the 100u and when the door
              is closed, the voltage on the anode lead drops to a low value but
              the diode does not allow the 100u to discharge - it only discharges
              via the 2M2.&nbsp; If the
              <b>Exit/Entry</b> door is left open, the main siren will wail after 45 seconds.
              Gate "<b>D</b>"
              (pins 12, 13 and 11) detects the voltage on the lower 100u and turns
              ON the buzzer. The input of the gate puts no load on the 100u (as it
              has a very high impedance) and it is discharged via the 2M2. <br>
              The piezo buzzer can be a 5v device and a 100R resistor will be
              needed in series with one lead to reduce the volume.

              Build the circuit on a piece of matrix board (or the Circuit
              Board included in the
              kit) and connect the inputs to the screw terminals. 6 separate
              2-screw terminals are provided in the kit to make it easy to wire-up
              the alarm. The alarm takes about 1mA when monitoring a house and
              about 100mA when activated. <br>
              The siren is only activated ONCE for 5 minutes when a break-in
              occurs as this is the maximum allowable time for a siren to wail in
              Australia. <br>
              If you want the alarm to constantly wail after a break-in, push
              button A when the alarm is turned on (and the exit beep is being
              produced). The constantly wailing
              LED will flash. Push the button again and the 5 minute LED will
              flash. The button toggles
              between the two features. <br>
              You can use reed switches for the input devices for doors and
              drawers. You can also trap the burglar by placing money under a clip
              and have a very thin length of tinned copper wire wound around two
              pins. When the money is removed, the wire is pulled off the pins. A
              single strand of wire can be obtained from a length of hook-up flex. <br>

                HOW THE CIRCUIT WORKS
              </b>
              <br>
              Any of the inputs can be used for the Entry/Exit. <br>
              It is connected to the door you will use to enter
              or exit the property. The alarm gives you 45 seconds to exit. <br>
              When you enter the property, the buzzer turns on as soon as you open
              the door and beeps for 45 seconds to allow you to turn off the
              alarm. <br>
              If the alarm is not turned off, the main piezo siren produces a soft
              tone for 30 seconds and then
              a piercing wailing sound.

            </p>
            <p class="center">

            </p>
            <p>
              This allows you to turn off the alarm before the loud wailing is
              produced and is one of the best features of the alarm as the worry
              of false-triggering an alarm prevents many householders setting
              their alarm. <br>
              Any unused inputs must be connected with a link so
              the alarm can be set. <br>
              When the circuit is turned ON, you have 45 seconds to exit the
              premises. <br>
              The chip then&nbsp; flashes either the 5-min LED or the Constant LED
              to indicate if the siren will wail for 5 minutes or constantly. You
              can change the setting by pressing the button. The circuit then
              beeps for 45 seconds to give you time to exit the property. It then
              monitors all 4 inputs.

              The main chip contains an internal oscillator to drive a piezo diaphragm
              and also a wailing oscillator for the Piezo Siren. The Piezo Siren
              is an 80dB piezo diaphragm driven by a BD679 Darlington transistor
              with a 10mH choke to produce a high voltage for the diaphragm. <br>
              The chip operates on 5v and the rest of the circuit uses 12v. A very
              simple voltage-dropper consisting of 2 LEDs and 1k5 drops the 12v to
              5v.&nbsp;

            and prevents it clocking the chip, until the electro either charges or
            discharges. A buffer transistor can replace the

            This circuit will produce a beep-beep-beep from the piezo buzzer when the
            battery voltage falls to about 10v. <br>
            This is very handy when you have a battery powering a piece of
            equipment and you don't know its state of charge.&nbsp; <br>
            When the voltage is above 10v, the zener diode conducts and turns ON
            the first transistor. The voltage between the collector and emitter
            of this transistor is less than 0.3v and the voltage on the base of
            the second transistor is 0.3v. Thus the second transistor is not
            turned ON and it is effectively removed from the circuit. This means
            the reset pin of the CD 4060 is connected to the positive rail via a
            1M resistor. This puts a HIGH on the reset pin and turns the chip
            off and prevents the oscillator producing clock pulses. <br>
            The chip contains inverters between pins 9, 10 and 11 so that when
            components are connected to these pins, an oscillator is produced.
            <br>
            The technical name for this oscillator is called a CLOCK. <br>
            When pin 12 is taken HIGH it inhibits the oscillator (prevents the
            clock pulses passing to the divider stages). <br>
            When the battery voltage falls below 10v, the first&nbsp; transistor
            is turned OFF and the second transistor is turned ON. This takes the
            reset line to the 0v rail and the chip allows the clock pulses from
            the oscillator to pass to a set of flip flops arranged to divide the
            signal. Pin 7 divides the signal by 16 to produce a beep-beep-beep
            from the electro-mechanical buzzer. The buzzer normally produces a constant tone
            but output pin 7 goes HIGH/LOW at about one cycle per second and
            this turns the buzzer ON and OFF to produce a clearer alert signal.
            <br>
            The circuit takes 30uA when "sitting around" and less than 1mA when
            producing a beep. <br>
            If you do not have an electro-mechanical buzzer, a piezo diaphragm can be used.
            The output volume will not be as loud. The oscillator components
            will need to be changed to produce a higher clock frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            This frequency will be divided-down and detected at one or two of
            the outputs. You can try all the outputs to see what result is the
            best.&nbsp; <br>
            <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/BatteryLowBeeper-2.gif" width="405" height="300" border="0">&nbsp;
            <br>
            If you do not have a 9v1 zener, it can
            be made from 5v6 zener and 3v6 zener or a 5v6 and a white LED or two
            red LEDs. <br>
            It can also be made from three white LEDs and a red LED. <br>
            You can use a zener, LEDs and a signal diode to adjust the voltage
            to any desired value. <br>
            When a very small current flows though a zener, LED or diode, the
            characteristic voltage that develops across it is LESS than when its
            rated current flows. However this lower voltage can be used to
            produce a "trigger-point." The only way to determine this voltage is
            to add the component to the circuit.<br>
            The first transistor reacts at this trigger-point and the second
            transistor simply inverts the voltage on the collector. <br>
            The second transistor is not classified as an amplifier but an
            INVERTER.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

            <b>LED DICE</b>

            <br>
            This circuit produces a realistic effect of the "pips" on the
            face of a dice. The circuit has "slow-down" to give the effect of
            the dice "rolling."<br>

              A SIMPLER CIRCUIT:
            </b>
            <br>
            The circuit above can be simplified and output Pin 12 can be used to
            illuminate two of the LEDs as this line is HIGH for the times when
            Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are HIGH and goes LOW when Q5 - Q9 is HIGH.
            <br>
            This means the 4017 starts with Q0 HIGH. But Q0 is not an output.
            This means that when Q0 is HIGH, "carry out" is HIGH and "2" will be
            displayed. The next clock cycle will produce "3" on the display when
            Q1 is HIGH, then "4" when Q2 is HIGH, "5" when Q3 is HIGH and "6"
            when Q4 is HIGH. When Q5 goes HIGH, it illuminates "1" on the
            display because "carry out" goes LOW.

              WATER LEVEL DETECTOR
            </b>

            <br>
            This great project is available on eBay for about $6.00
            (posted). It shows LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH on LEDs as well as a relay
            output.&nbsp; See the <a href="WATER%20LEVEL%20DETECTOR.pdf" target="top">.pdf
              for full details</a>. <br>
            Here is the circuit:<br>
            <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/images/WaterDetectorCCt.gif" width="635" height="480" border="0"><br>
            The circuit is complex because it is well-designed and does not put
            DC on the probes. The AC prevents galvanic reaction "eating" the
            probes and destroying them. <br>
            The switch in the base of the first transistor effectively "toggles"
            (reverses) the action of the relay. You don't really need this
            complexity as you can simply wire your motor to the normally-open or
            normally-closed contacts. <br>
            However the circuit is a good introduction to op-amp designs and the
            full explanation of how it works is in the .pdf.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            The circuit has been redrawn from the Chinese original to make it
            easy to see how it works. You have absolutely no chance of working
            out how it works from the Chinese version. I don't know how they
            teach electronics with their way of laying things out.&nbsp; I
            certainly couldn't follow anything. It was all "Chinese" (Greek) to
            me. <br>
            <br>

            The resistor values have been added to the image as they are hidden
            under the components. If the project does not work, you will find
            two resistors have been fitted incorrectly. This photo will help you
            locate the problem. The colour bands for each resistor is in the .pdf.
            They are all 1% resistors and you need help to check the colours.&nbsp; &nbsp;
            Don't forget, the 223 looks the same as 104.

              I'm writing regarding your water level detector article above.<br>
              It helped me to troubleshoot a new install of a deep-well bore pump
              controller that I'm using this kit for.<br>
              Here is some feedback on the issues I had, which were mainly
              inconsistent operation and instability:<br>
              <br>
              The inconsistent operation seems to have been cured by replacing R14
              with a 680R resistor. R14 is supplied and is listed on the circuit
              board as 47k, but it should be 680R. It supplies the (+)ve input of
              the low-probe comparator circuit and it should be the same value as
              R5, which has the identical function in the high-probe comparator
              circuit. I also found another schematic for this board at
              <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vw5k8wh-CtQ4nLVdZ_kVCY2OvTOzHVgK" target="new">
                https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vw5k8wh-CtQ4nLVdZ_kVCY2OvTOzHVgK</a>
              which shows R14 as 680R.<br>
              The other problem I had was oscillation when the probes were
              connected but not immersed. This was caused I think by the self
              capacitance of the 27m long probe cable, which allowed some ac
              current through. The fix was to increase the capacitance in both
              diode pumps (C4 &amp; C9), from 100nF to 220nF.

              DOOR ALARM
            </b>&nbsp;<br>
            This circuit produces two different effects on the LED. It is
            best to put a piezo diaphragm on pin 11 to hear the tone (frequency)
            produced by the circuit. <br>
            The circuit is a good example to test your ability to work out what
            is happening. <br>
            When the magnet is near the Hall effect device, the output is LOW
            and pin 3 must be HIGH (refer to the truth table). This puts a high on pin 2 and the gate
            remains in this state.<br>
            Pin 4 is LOW and pin 10 is HIGH. <br>
            Pin 11 can be high or low and if we assume the 100n is not charged,
            pin 13 will be low and the output will be HIGH. This will charge the
            100n and change pin 13 to HIGH to make the output LOW and thus we
            have an oscillator. The piezo diaphragm will produce a tone but the
            LED will simply be illuminated.<br>
            When the magnet is removed, pin 1 goes HIGH and&nbsp;the output can
            be high or low. We will assume pin 3 goes LOW as it was previously
            HIGH and the 10u was fully charged. <br>
            Pin 4 goes HIGH and the 10u is "jacked up" by 9v due to pin 4 rising
            and the about 8v contained in (or on) the 10u puts 17v on the join
            of the 1M and 100k resistors. <br>
            The other end of the 100k is at 0v and this resistor discharges the
            10u fully and then starts to charge it in the opposite direction as
            the negative of the electro will be at 9v and the positive lead has
            to drop to less than 3v. Pin 2 monitors the voltage via the 1M
            resistor. <br>
            When pin 2 sees less than 3v, the gate changes state with pin 2
            going HIGH and the second gate changes state with pin 4 going LOW.
            <br>
            The electro has MINUS 6v across it but the way to see it is this:
            The electro is "moved down" by 9v and now the join of the 1M and
            100k resistors sees a voltage of minus 15v. <br>
            The other end of the 100k resistor has 9v on it and this removes the
            charge from the electro so that it has 0v across it and then it
            charges in the correct direction until the voltage reaches about 6v.&nbsp;
            <br>
            At this point the gate changes state with pin 3 going LOW and pin 4
            going HIGH to create a low frequency oscillator. <br>
            Previously pins 4, 8 and 9 were LOW. <br>
            When these pins are HIGH, pin 10 is LOW. When this pin is LOW it
            permanently puts a HIGH on the output of the gate and the LED is
            turned OFF. <br>
            This makes the LED blink when the magnet is removed.<p>

                circuit-board. &nbsp;<br>
                Sometimes a component is drawn with each pin in the same
                place as on the chip etc. But this is rarely the case. <br>
                Most often there is no relationship between the position of
                the lines on the circuit and the pins on the component. <br>
                <br>
                That’s what makes reading a circuit so complex. <br>
                <br>
                This is very important to remember with transistors, voltage
                regulators, chips and so many other components as the
                position of the pins on the symbol are not in the same
                places as the pins or leads on the component and sometimes the pins
                have different functions according to the manufacturer.&nbsp;
                Sometimes the pin numbering is different according to the
                component, such as positive and negative regulators. <br>
                <br>
                You must to refer to the manufacturer’s specification sheet
                to identify each pin, to be sure you have identified them
                correctly. <br>

                The following list covers just a few of the IC's on the
                market and these are the "simple" or "basic" or
                "digital" or "op-amp" IC's suitable for experimenting.
                <br>
                When designing a circuit around an IC, you have to remember
                two things: <br>
                1. Is the IC still available? and <br>
                2. Can the circuit be designed around a microcontroller?<br>
                Sometimes a circuit using say 3 or 4 IC's can be re-designed
                around an 8-pin or 16-pin microcontroller and the program can be be
                kept from prying eyes due to a feature called "code
                protection." A microcontroller project is more
                up-to-date, can be cheaper and can be re-programmed to alter
                the features. <br>
                This will be covered in the next eBook. It is worth
                remembering - as it is the way of the future.
