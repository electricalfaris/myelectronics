            This is the second half of our
            <b><b>ransistor
                Circuits</b> e-book. It contains a
              further 100 circuits, with many of them containing one or more Integrated
              Circuits (ICs).<br>
              It's amazing what you can do with transistors but when Integrated
              Circuits came along, the whole field of electronics exploded. <br>
              IC's can handle both analogue as well as digital signals but before
              their arrival, nearly all circuits were analogue or very simple
              "digital" switching circuits.<br>
              Let's explain what we mean. <br>
              The word analogue is a waveform or signal that is changing
              (increasing and decreasing) at a constant or non constant rate. Examples
              are voice, music, tones, sounds and frequencies. Equipment such as
              radios, TV's and amplifiers process analogue signals. <br>
              Then digital came along. <br>
              Digital is similar to a switch turning something on and off. <br>
              The advantage of digital is two-fold. <br>
              Firstly it is a very reliable and accurate way to send a signal. The
              signal is either HIGH or LOW&nbsp; (ON or OFF). It cannot be half-on or
              one quarter off. <br>
              And secondly, a circuit that is ON, consumes the least amount of energy
              in the controlling device. In other words, a transistor that is fully
              turned ON and driving a motor, dissipates the least amount of heat. If
              it is slightly turned ON or nearly fully turned ON, it gets very hot.
              <br>
              And obviously a transistor that is not turned on at all will consume no
              energy. <br>
              A transistor that turns ON fully and OFF fully is called a SWITCH. <br>
              When two transistors are cross-coupled in the form of a flip flop, any
              pulses entering the circuit cause it to flip and flop and the output
              goes HIGH on every second pulse. This means the circuit halves the input
              pulses and is the basis of counting or dividing. <br>
              Digital circuits also introduce the concept of two inputs creating a
              HIGH output when both are HIGH and variations of this. <br>
              This is called "logic" and introduces terms such as "Boolean algebra"
              and "gates." <br>
              Integrated Circuits started with a few transistors in each "chip" and
              increased to whole mini or micro computers in a single chip. These chips
              are called Microcontrollers and a single chip with a few surrounding
              components can be programmed to play games, monitor heart-rate and do
              all sorts of amazing things. Because they can process information at
              high speed, the end result can appear to have intelligence and this is
              where we are heading: <b>AI</b> (Artificial Intelligence). <br>
              <br>
              But let's crawl before we walk and come to understand how to interface
              some of these chips to external components. <br>
              In this Transistor Circuits ebook, we have presented about 100
              interesting circuits using transistors and chips. <br>
              In most cases the IC will contain 10 - 100 transistors, cost less than
              the individual components and take up much less board-space. They also
              save a lot of circuit designing and quite often consume less current
              than discrete components. <br>
              In all, they are a fantastic way to get something working with the least
              componentry. <br>
              A list of of Integrated Circuits (Chips) is provided at the end of this
              book to help you identify the pins and show you what is inside the chip.
              <br>
              Some of the circuits are available from Talking Electronics as a kit,
              but others will have to be purchased as individual components from your
              local electronics store.
              Electronics is such an enormous field that we cannot provide kits for
              everything. But if you have a query about one of the circuits, you can
              contact me.<br>

            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              There are two ways to learn electronics. <br>
              One is to go to school and study theory for 4 years and come out with
              all the theoretical knowledge in the world but almost no practical
              experience. <br>
              We know this type of person. We employed them (for a few weeks!). They
              think everything they design WILL WORK because their university
              professor said so. <br>
              The other way is to build circuit after circuit and get things to work.
              You may not know the in-depth theory of how it works but trial and error
              gets you there. <br>
              We know. We employed this type of person for up to 12 years. <br>
              I am not saying one is better than the other but most electronics
              enthusiasts are not "book worms" and anyone can succeed in this field by
              constantly applying themselves with "constructing
              projects." You actually learn 10 times faster by applying yourself and we
              have had technicians repairing equipment after only a few weeks on the
              job. <br>
              It would be nothing for an enthusiast to build 30 - 40 circuits
              from our previous Transistor eBook and a similar number from this book.
              Many of the circuits are completely different to each other and all have
              a building block or two that you can learn from. <br>
              Electronics enthusiasts have an uncanny understanding of how a circuit
              works and if you have this ability, don't let it go to waste. <br>
              Electronics will provide you a comfortable living for the rest of your
              life and I mean this quite seriously. The market is very&nbsp; narrow
              but new designs are coming along all the time and new devices
              are constantly being invented and more are always needed. <br>
              Once you get past this eBook of "Chips and Transistors" you will want to
              investigate microcontrollers and this is when your options will explode.
              <br>
              You will be able to carry out tasks you never thought possible, with a
              chip as small as 8 pins and a few hundred lines of code. <br>
              As I say in my speeches. What is the difference between a "transistor
              man" and a "programmer?"&nbsp; TWO WEEKS!<br>
              In two weeks you can start to understand the programming code for a
              microcontroller and perform simple tasks such as flashing a LED and
              produce sounds and outputs via the press of a button. <br>
              All these things are covered on
              <a href="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/">Talking Electronics website</a>
              and you don't have to buy any books or publications. Everything is
              available on the web and it is instantly accessible. That's the beauty
              of the web. <br>
              Don't think things are greener on the other side of the fence, by buying
              a text book. They aren't. Everything you need is on the web AT NO COST.
              <br>
              The only thing you have to do is build things. If you have any
              technical problem at all, simply email
              <a href="mailto:talking@tpg.com.au?subject=Ask Colin Mitchell any technical question">
                Colin Mitchell</a> and any question will be answered. Nothing could be
              simpler and this way we guarantee you SUCCESS. Hundreds of readers have
              already emailed and after 5 or more emails, their circuit works. That's
              the way we work. One thing at a time and eventually the fault is found.
              <br>
              If you think a circuit will work the first time it is turned on, you are
              fooling yourself. <br>
              All circuits need corrections and improvements and that's what makes a
              good electronics person.&nbsp;Don't give up. How do you think all
              the circuits in these eBooks were designed?
              Some were copied and some were designed from scratch but all had to be
              built and adjusted slightly to make sure they&nbsp; worked perfectly.
              <br>
              I don't care if you use bread-board, copper strips, matrix board or
              solder the components in the air as a "bird's nest."&nbsp; You only learn when the
              circuit gets turned on and WORKS!<br>
              In fact the rougher you build something, the more you will guarantee it will
              work when built on a printed circuit board. <br>
              However, high-frequency circuits (such as 100MHz&nbsp; FM Bugs) do not
              like open layouts and you have to keep the construction as tight as
              possible to get them to operate reliably. <br>
              In most other cases, the layout is not critical. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>TRANSISTORS<br>
              </b> Most of the transistors
              used in our circuits are BC 547 and BC 557. These are classified as
              "universal" or "common" NPN and PNP types with a voltage rating of about
              25v, 100mA collector current and a gain of about 100. Some magazines use
              the term "<b>TUP</b>" (for Transistor Universal PNP) or "<b>TUN</b>"
              (for Transistor Universal NPN). We simply use Philips types that
              everyone recognises.&nbsp;
              You can use almost any type of transistor to replace them and here is a list of
              the equivalents and pinouts:<br>

          <b>RECTIFYING a Voltage <br>
          </b>
          These circuits show how to change an
          oscillating voltage (commonly called AC) to DC. The term AC means
          Alternating Current but it really means Alternating Voltage as the
          rising and falling voltage produces an increasing and decreasing
          current. <br>
          The term DC means Direct Current but it actually means Direct or
          unchanging Voltage. <br>
          The output of the following circuits will not be pure DC (like that
          from a battery) but will contain ripple. Ripple is reduced by adding
          a capacitor (electrolytic) to the output.&nbsp;<br>

          </b>
          This circuit detects darkness and
          produces a beep-beep-beep alarm. The first two transistors form a
          high-gain amplifier with feedback via the 4u7 to produce a low-frequency
          oscillator. This provides voltage for the second oscillator (across
          the 1k resistor) to drive
          a speaker.

              width="335" height="200" border="0" class="left"><b>TRANSFORMERLESS POWER SUPPLY<br>
            </b>This clever design uses 4
            diodes in a bridge to produce a fixed voltage power supply capable
            of supplying 35mA. <br>
            <b>All diodes</b> (every type of diode) are zener diodes. They all
            break down at a particular voltage. The fact is, a power diode
            breaks down at 100v or 400v and its zener characteristic is not
            useful. <br>
            But if we put 2 zener diodes in a bridge with two ordinary power
            diodes, the bridge will break-down at the voltage of the zener. This
            is what we have done. If we use 18v zeners, the output will be 17v4.
            <br>
            When the incoming voltage is
            positive at the top, the left zener provides 18v limit (and the other
            zener produces a drop of 0.6v)&nbsp; This allows the right zener to
            pass current just like a normal diode.&nbsp; The output is 17v4. The same with the
            other half-cycle.
            <br>
            The current is limited by the value of the X2 capacitors and
            this is 7mA for each 100n when in full-wave (as per this circuit).
            We have 1u capacitance. Theoretically the circuit will
            supply 70mA but we found it will only deliver 35mA before the output
            drops. The capacitors should comply with X1 or X2 class. The 10R is a
            safety-fuse resistor. <br>
            The problem with this power supply is the "live" nature of the
            negative rail. When the power supply is connected as shown, the
            negative rail is 0.7v above neutral. If the mains is reversed, the
            negative rail is 340v (peak) above neutral and this will kill you as
            the current will flow through the diode and be lethal. You need to
            touch the negative rail (or the positive rail) and any earthed
            device such as a toaster to get killed. The only solution is the
            project being powered must be totally enclosed in a box with no
            outputs. <br>
            A <b>TRANSFORMERLESS POWER SUPPLY</b> is also called a <b>CAPACITOR
              FED POWER SUPPLY</b>. <br>
            It is very dangerous. <br>
            Here's why:<br>

            A <b>Capacitor Power Supply</b> uses a capacitor to interface
            between a “high voltage supply” and a low voltage – called THE POWER
            SUPPLY. <br>
            In other words a capacitor is placed between a “high voltage supply”
            we call THE MAINS (between 110v and 240v) and a low voltage that may
            be 9v to
            12v. <br>
            Even though a capacitor consists of two plates that do not touch
            each other, a <b>Capacitor Power Supply</b> is a very dangerous project,
            for two reasons. <br>
            You may not think electricity can pass though a capacitor because it
            consists of plates that do not touch each other. <br>
            But a capacitor works in a slightly different way. A capacitor
            connected to the mains works like this:<br>
            Consider a magnet on one side of a door. On the other side we have a
            sheet of metal. As you slide the magnet up the door, the sheet of
            metal rises too. <br>
            The same with a capacitor. As the voltage on one side of the
            capacitor rises, the voltage on the other side is “pulled out of the
            ground” &nbsp;- and it rises too. <br>
            If you stand on the ground and hold one lead of the capacitor and
            connect the other to the active side of the “mains,” the capacitor
            will “pull” 120v or 240v “out of the ground” and you will get a
            shock. <br>
            Don’t ask “how” or “why.” &nbsp;This is just the simplest way to describe
            how you get a shock via a capacitor that consists of two plates.
            <br>
            If the capacitor “shorts” between the two plates, the 120v
            or 240v will be delivered to your power supply and create damage.
            <br>
            Secondly, if any of the components in your power supply become
            open-circuit, the voltage on the power supply will increase.
            <br>
            But the most dangerous feature of this type of power supply is
            reversal of the mains leads. <br>
            The circuit is designed so that the neutral lead goes to the earth
            of your power supply. <br>
            This means the active is connected to the capacitor. <br>
            Now, the way the active works is this:<br>
            The active lead rises 120x 1.4 = 180v in the positive direction and
            then drops to 180v in the opposite direction. In other words it is
            180v higher than the neutral line then 180v lower than the neutral.
            <br>
            For 240v mains, this is 325v higher then 325v lower. <br>
            The neutral is connected to the chassis of your project and if you
            touch it, nothing will happen. It does not rise or fall. <br>
            But suppose you connect the power leads around the wrong way.<br>
            The active is now connected to the chassis and if you touch the
            chassis and a water pipe, you will get a 180v or 345v shock. <br>
            That’s why a CAPACITOR-FED power supply must be totally isolated.
            <br>
            Now we come to the question:&nbsp; How does a capacitor produce a 12v
            power supply?<br>
            When a capacitor is connected to the mains, one lead is rising and
            falling. <br>
            Depending on the size of the capacitor, it will allow current to
            flow into and out of the other lead. <br>
            If the capacitor is a large value, a high current will flow into and
            out of the lead. In addition, a high voltage will allow a higher
            current to flow. <br>
            This current is “taken out of the ground” and “flows back into the
            ground.” <br>
            It does not come from the mains. The mains only: “influences” the
            flow of current. <br>
            Thus we have a flow of current into and out of the capacitor. <br>
            If you put a resistor between the capacitor and “ground,” the amount
            of current that will flow, depends on 3 things, the amplitude of the
            voltage, the size of the capacitor and the speed of the rise and
            fall. <br>
            When current flows through a resistor, a voltage develops across the
            resistor and if we select the correct value of resistance, we will
            get a 12v power supply. <br>
            <br>
            <b>THE OUTPUT
              VOLTAGE <br>
            </b>The <b>OUTPUT VOLTAGE</b> of
            all transformerless power supplies will be about 50% HIGHER than the
            mains voltage if a LOAD is not connected. That's RIGHT: The output
            of a 120v CAPACITOR POWER SUPPLY (transformerless power supply) will
            be about 180v and a 240v mains transformerless power supply will be
            about 345v. <br>
            <br>
            It works like this:&nbsp; The transformerless power supply is a
            CURRENT-DELIVERED power supply. In other words we have to talk about
            CURRENT-VALUES and not voltages. <br>
            For a bridge circuit (called a full-wave design) it will deliver 7mA
            for each 100n. Suppose we have 220n. We have 15mA available. <br>
            We take the 15mA and say: How many volts will develop across a 100R
            load?&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer = 0.015 x 100 = 15v. I f we use 82R the
            voltage will be about 12v.&nbsp; If we use 220R the voltage will be
            33v. That's how the output voltage is developed. <br>
            If you add another 220n across the 220n, the voltages will be
            DOUBLE. It's as simple as that.

              width="260" height="245" &nbsp;LEDs on 240v<br>
            </b>I do not like any circuit connected directly to 240v
            mains. However Christmas tress lights have been connected directly to
            the mains for 30 years without any major problems. <br>
            Insulation must be provided and the lights (LEDs) must be away from
            prying fingers. <br>
            You need at least 50 LEDs in each string
            to prevent them being damaged
            via a surge through the 1k resistor - if the circuit is turned on at the
            peak of the waveform. As you add more LEDs to each string, the current will drop
            a very small amount until eventually, when you have 90 LEDs in each
            string, the current will be zero. <br>
            For 50 LEDs in each string, the total characteristic voltage will be
            180v so that the peak voltage will be 330v - 180v = 150v. Each LED will see
            less than 7mA peak during the half-cycle
            they are illuminated. The 1k resistor will drop 7v - since the RMS
            current is 7mA&nbsp; (7mA x 1,000 ohms = 7v). No rectifier diodes are
            needed. The LEDs are the "rectifiers."&nbsp; Very clever. You must have LEDs
            in both directions to charge and discharge the capacitor. The resistor
            is provided to take a heavy surge current through one of the strings of
            LEDs if the circuit is switched on when the mains is at a peak.<br>
            This can be as high as 330mA if only 1 LED is used, so the value of this
            resistor must be adjusted if a small number of LEDs are used.
            The LEDs above detect
            peak current.<br>
            <b>A
              100n cap will deliver 7mA RMS or 10mA peak in full wave or 3.5mA RMS
              (10mA peak for half a cycle) in half-wave. </b>&nbsp;(when only 1 LED is
            in each string)<b>.<br>
              <br>
            </b>
            <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/CapacitorSupply.gif"
              width="260" height="240" The current-capability of a capacitor needs more explanation.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;
              diagram on the left we see a capacitor feeding a full-wave power supply. This is exactly the same as the
              <b>LEDs on 240v</b> circuit above.
            Imagine the LOAD resistor is removed. Two of the diodes will face down
            and two will face up. This is exactly the same as the LEDs facing up and
            facing down in the circuit above. The only difference is the mid-point
            is joined. Since the voltage on the mid-point of one string is the same
            as the voltage at the mid-point of the other string, the link can be
            removed and the circuit will operate the same. <br>
            This means each 100n of capacitance will deliver 7mA RMS (10mA peak
            on each half-cycle). <br>
            In the half-wave supply, the capacitor delivers 3.5mA RMS (10mA peak on
            each half-cycle, but one half-cycle is lost in the diode)&nbsp;
            for each 100n to the load, and during the other half-cycle the 10mA peak
            is lost in the diode that discharges the capacitor.&nbsp; <br>
            You can use any LEDs and try to keep the total voltage-drop in each
            string equal. Each string is actually working on DC. It's not constant
            DC but varying DC. In fact is it zero current for 1/2 cycle then nothing
            until the voltage rises above the total characteristic voltage of all
            the LEDs, then a gradual
            increase in current over the remainder of the
            cycle, then a gradual decrease to zero over the falling portion of the cycle, then
            nothing
            for 1/2 cycle. Because the LEDs turn on and off, you may observe some
            flickering and that's why the two strings should be placed together.

            can be adjusted to any value from a few milliamp to about 500mA -
            this is the limit of the BC337 transistor. <br>
            The circuit can also be called a current-limiting circuit and is
            ideal in a bench power supply to prevent the circuit you are testing
            from being damaged. <br>
            Approximately 4v is dropped across the regulator and 1.25v across
            the current-limiting section, so the input voltage (supply) has to
            be 5.25v above the required output voltage.&nbsp; Suppose you want
            to charge 4 Ni-Cad cells. Connect them to the output and adjust the
            500R pot until the required charge-current is obtained. <br>
            The charger will now charge 1, 2, 3 or 4 cells at the same current.
            But you must remember to turn off the charger before the cells are
            fully charged as the circuit will not detect this and over-charge
            the cells.
            <br>
            The LM 317 3-terminal regulator will need to be heatsinked. <br>
            This circuit is designed for the LM series of regulator as they have
            a voltage differential of 1.25v between "adj" and "out" terminals.
            <br>
            7805 regulators can be used but the losses in the BC337 will be 4
            times greater as the voltage across it will be 5v.

              THE POWER SUPPLY<br>

            </b>

            The simplest power supply is a transformer, diode and electrolytic:

            <p class="center">
              <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/PowerSupply-1.gif"

            <p>

              But the ripple will be very high because only every alternate
              portion of the ac signal is being passed through the diode and the
              electrolytic (called the filter capacitor) cannot smooth the ripple
              very well.
              The result will be a loud hum if powering an amplifier. <br>
              <br>
              An improvement is to use a bridge rectifier. This will reduce the
              ripple and reduce the hum because the waveform to the electrolytic
              consists of pulses that are closer together and the electrolytic
              does not have to supply as much energy because the pulses are closer
              together.

                ZENER REGULATION<br>

              </b>

              The next improvement is to reduce the ripple with a zener diode. <br>
              The zener diode is placed across the voltage you want to smooth and
              as the voltage increases, the zener diode turns ON more and
              additional current flows through it to the 0v rail. This reduces the voltage
              but the result is a smoother voltage.&nbsp; <br>
              This is called a SHUNT REGULATOR or ZENER SHUNT REGULATOR or ZENER
              DIODE STABILIZER.
            </p>
            <p class="center">

            <p>


              In place of a zener, we can use a transistor. <b>


                <br>
                THE SHUNT TRANSISTOR <br>

              </b>A transistor placed across the voltage
              to be regulated (or stabilized) is called a SHUNT TRANSISTOR,
              because it shunts or sends the unwanted extra waveform to the 0v
              rail, and thereby smoothes the voltage. <br>
              It uses a zener to sense the voltage as in the zener regulator
              circuit above, but the current through the zener is less because the
              transistor turns ON and reduces the voltage. A lower-wattage zener
              diode can be used and since less current flows through it, the
              voltage across it will be more stable. <br>
              This arrangement is better than a zener diode regulator
              due the improved stability of the diode with less current flowing
              through it and the circuit will deliver about 100 times more current
              due to the inclusion of the transistor.<br>
              However, this circuit is very wasteful because the maximum current is <b>

              a load (such as an amplifier), the current is diverted from the

              THE ELECTRONIC FILTER<br>

            </b>

            Here is a simple circuit to reduce the ripple from a power supply by a
            factor of about 100. This means a 20mV ripple will be 0.2mV and will not
            be noticed. This is important when you are powering an FM bug from a
            plug pack. The background hum is annoying and very difficult to remove
            with electrolytics. This circuit is the answer. The 1k and 100u form a
            filter that makes the 100u <b>one hundred times</b> more effective than if
            placed directly on the supply-line. The transistor detects the voltage
            on the base and also detects the very small ripple. <br>
            As current is taken by the load, about 100th of this current is
            required by the base and if the load current is 100mA, the current
            into the base will be 1mA and one volt will be dropped across the 1k
            resistor. <br>
            The circuit is suitable for up to
            100mA. A power transistor can be used, but the 1k will have to be
            reduced to 220R for 500mA output. The output of the circuit is about
            2v less than the output of the plug pack.<br>
            By adding a zener across the electro, the output voltage
            will remain much more constant (fixed). <br>
            If a zener is not added, the output voltage will drop as the current
            increases due to a factor called REGULATION. This is the inability
            of the small transformer to provide a constant voltage.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The addition of the 3 components only reduces the RIPPLE portion of
            the voltage - and does not change the fact that the voltage will
            droop when current is increased. It requires a zener to fix this
            problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            This circuit can also be called: RIPPLE SUPPRESSOR, RIPPLE REDUCER
            or CAPACITANCE MULTIPLIER.&nbsp; The 100u can be increased to 470u
            or 1,000u.<p class="center">

            100mA. You can use any old cells and get the last of their energy.
            Use an 8-cell holder. The voltage from 8 old cells will be about 10v
            and the circuit will operate down to about 7.5v. The regulation is
            very good at 10v, only dropping about 10mV for 100mA current flow
            (the 78L05 has 1mV drop).&nbsp;
            As the voltage drops, the output drops from 5v on no-load to 4.8v
            and 4.6v on 100mA current-flow. The pot can be adjusted to
            compensate for the voltage-drop. This type of circuit is called a
            LINEAR REGULATOR and is not very efficient (about 50% in this case).
            See circuit 2 below for BUCK REGULATOR circuit (about 85%

            collector-emitter leads. <br>
            The output voltage is maintained by the 3-terminal regulator but the
            current flows through the "pass transistor." This transistor is a
            power transistor and must be adequately heatsinked. <br>
            Normally a 2N3055 or TIP3055 is used for this application as it will
            handle up to 10 amps and creates a 10 amp power supply.&nbsp; The
            regulator can be 78L05 as all the current is delivered by the pass
            transistor.

            <b>LED DETECTS LIGHT<br>
            </b>The LED in this circuit will

            work. But green LEDs, yellow LEDs and high-bright white LEDs and
            high-bright red
            LEDs work very well. <br>
            The output voltage of the LED is up to 600mV when detecting&nbsp; very
            bright illumination. <br>
            When light is detected by the LED, its resistance decreases and a
            very small current flows into the base of the first transistor. The
            transistor amplifies this current about 200 times&nbsp; and the
            resistance between collector and emitter decreases. The 330k
            resistor on the collector is a current limiting resistor as the
            middle transistor only needs a very small current for the circuit to
            oscillate. If the current is too high, the circuit will "freeze."<br>

                  <p>To use this circuit you have to understand some of the

                    &nbsp;<br>
                    When the signal is HIGH it has <b>driving power</b> and is
                    classified a low impedance and it will only turn ON the

                    is turned ON, you will have no problem. <br>
                    But if the signal is LOW when the 12v power is applied, the
                    <b>signal-line</b> will be effectively "floating" and the
                    four 1k resistors in series will turn on both transistors.
                    <br>
                    The 10u is designed to delay to BC547 and it will produce
                    the longer pulse to de-activate the relay.&nbsp; <br>
                    You will have to adjust the value of the resistors and
                    electrolytics to get the required pulse length and the
                    required delay. This circuit is just a "starting-point."<br>

            <b>TOGGLE A RELAY<br>
            </b>This circuit will activate a relay when the
            switch is pressed and released quickly and turn the relay off when
            the switch is pressed for about 1 second then released. <br>
            The circuit relies on a few component values to operate correctly
            and they may need to be adjusted to get the circuit to operate
            exactly as required. <br>
            When the switch is pressed, The BC557 turns ON and supplies nearly
            rail voltage to the relay. <br>
            This closes the contacts and the BC547 is capable of delivering a
            current to the relay. <br>
            The transistor acts just like a resistor with a resistance equal to
            1/250 the value of the base resistor. This is 40 ohms. If the relay
            has a coil resistance of 250 ohms, it will see a voltage of about
            10v for a 12v supply. <br>
            When the switch is released, the BC547 keeps the relay energised.
            <br>
            During this activation, the 220u electrolytic helps in activating
            the relay. <br>
            Here's how: <br>
            Initially the 220u is charged (quite slowly) via the 10k resistor 68
            ohm resistor and the coil of the relay. <br>
            It is now fully charged and when the switch is pressed, the negative
            end of the electrolytic is raised via the collector of the BC557.
            The positive end rises too and this action raises the emitter and
            when the relay contacts close, the relay is delivered current fro
            both the BC557 and and BC547. When the sw is released, the BC547
            takes over and the discharging of the 220u into the base, holds the
            relay closed. <br>
            As the 220u gradually discharges, the ability of the BC547 to
            deliver current reduces slightly and the 10k base resistor takes
            over and turns the transistor into a 40R resistor. <br>
            Finally the 220u has a very small voltage across it. <br>
            When the switch is pressed again, the BC547 acts as a resistor with
            a resistance less than 40 ohms and it is able to deliver a voltage
            slightly higher than that provided by the BC547. <br>
            This slightly higher voltage is passed to the negative lead of the
            220u and the positive lead actually rises about rail voltage and the
            electro gets discharged via the 10k resistor.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            When the switch is released, the electro has less than 0.6v across
            it and the BC547 transistor is not able to deliver current to the
            relay. The relay is de-activated. <p class="center">

                The relay is powered by say 12v, via a MAIN SWITCH. When the relay
                is activated, the motor travels in the&nbsp; forward direction and
                hits the "up limit" switch. The motor stops. When the MAIN SWITCH is
                turned off, the relay is de-activated and reverses the motor until
                it reaches th e "down-limit" switch and stops. The MAIN SWITCH must
                be used to send the motor to the "up limit" switch.

            Normally the Timer turns on a lamp. Our circuit uses a Wall Wart in

            The relay sends (say) positive out the top lead and when the top
            limit switch is opened by the motor reaching the end of its travel,
            it stops. The top 1N5404 prevents current passing to the motor. At 5PM the Mains timer turns the relay OFF
            and
            it sends negative out the top lead. The top 3 amp diode allows
            the motor to reverse and then the limit switch closes. When it
            reaches the lower limit switch, the switch opens and the lower diode
            prevents current flowing to the motor.

            </b>
            A very simple battery monitor can
            be made with a dual-colour LED and a few surrounding components. The
            LED produces orange when the red and green LEDs are illuminated. <br>
            The following circuit turns on the red LED below 10.5v<br>
            The orange LED illuminates between 10.5v and 11.6v. <br>
            The green LED illuminates above 11.6v<p>

              The
              following circuit monitors a single Li-ION cell. The green LED
              illuminates
              when the voltage is above 3.5v and the goes out when the voltage
              falls below 3.4v. The red LED then illuminates.

              Adjust the 560k for the voltage at which the LED turns ON. No
              current-limiting resistor is needed as the transistor only allows a
              few milliamp collector curent.

            (The first thing you have to do is measure the resistance of the

            This circuit
            can be used to turn on a tape
            recorder when the phone line voltage is less than 15v. This is the
            approximate voltage when the handset is picked up. See Phone Tape-1
            and Phone Tape-2 in <b>200 Transistor Circuits eBook (circuits 1 -
              100).</b>&nbsp; When the line voltage is above 25v, the BC547 is
            turned on and this robs the base of the second BC547 of the 1.2v it needs
            to turn on. <br>
            When the line voltage drops, the first BC547 turns off and the 10u
            charges via the 47k and gradually the second BC547 is turned on.
            This action turns on the BC338 and the resistance between its
            collector-emitter leads reduces. Two leads are taken from the BC338
            to the "rem" (remote) socket on a tape recorder. When the lead is plugged
            into a tape recorder, the motor will stop. If the motor does not
            stop,&nbsp;a second remote lead has been included with the wires
            connected the opposite way. This lead will work. The audio
            for the tape recorder is also shown on the diagram. This circuit has
            the advantage that it does not need a battery. It will work on a
            30v phone line as well as a 50v phone line. <br>

            This circuit&nbsp; is identical in operation to the
            circuit above but uses FET's (Field Effect Transistors.<br>
            15v zeners are used to prevent the gate of each FET from rising
            above 15v. <br>
            A FET has two advantages over a transistor in this type of circuit.
            <br>
            1. It takes very little current into the gate to turn it on. This
            means the gate resistor can be very high. <br>
            2. The voltage developed across the output of a FET is very low when
            the FET is turned on.&nbsp; This means the motor in the tape
            recorder will operate at full strength. <br>
            This circuit has not been tested and the 10k resistor (in series
            with the first 15v zener) creates a low impedance and the circuit
            may not work on some phone systems. <br>

              In the diagram, it looks like the
              coils sit on the “table” while the magnet has its edge on the table.
              This is just a diagram to show how the parts are connected. The
              coils actually sit flat against the slide (against the side of the
              magnet) as shown in the diagram:<br>

              <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/ShakeTicTacLEDtorch.gif"
                width="395" height="340" The output voltage depends on how quickly the magnet passes from one end of the
                slide to the other. That's why a rapid shaking produces a higher voltage. You must get the end of the
                magnet to fully pass though the coil so the voltage will be a maximum. That’s why the slide extends past
                the coils at the top and bottom of the diagram.<br>
              <br>
              The circuit consists of two 600-turn coils in series, driving a
              voltage doubler. Each coil produces a positive and negative pulse,
              each time the magnet passes from one end of the slide to the other.
              <br>
              The positive pulse charges the top electrolytic via the top diode
              and the negative pulse charges the lower<br>
              electrolytic, via the lower
              diode. <br>
              The voltage across each electrolytic is combined to produce a
              voltage for the white LED. When the combined voltage is greater than
              3.2v, the LED illuminates.
              The electrolytics help to keep the LED illuminated while the magnet
              starts to make another pass.

                This is the circuit from a HEX
                BUG. It is a surface-mount bug with 6 legs. The pager motor is
                driven by an H-Bridge and "walks" to a wall where a feeler
                (consisting of a spring with a stiff wire down the middle) causes
                the motor to reverse. <br>
                In the forward direction, both sets of legs are driven by the
                compound gearbox but when&nbsp; the motor is reversed, the left legs
                do not operate as they are connected by a clutch consisting of a
                spring-loaded inclined plane that does not operate in reverse. <br>
                This causes the bug to turn around slightly.<br>
                The circuit also responds to a loud clap. The photo shows the 9

              <br>
              Hex Bug gearbox consists of a compound gearbox with
              output "K" (eccentric pin) driving the legs. You will need to see
              the project to understand how the legs operate. <br>
              When the motor is reversed, the clutch "F" is a housing that is
              spring-loaded to "H" and drives "H via a square shaft "G". Gearwheel
              "C" is an idler and the centre of "F" is connected to "E" via the
              shaft. When "E" reverses, the centre of "F" consists of a driving
              inclined plane and pushes "F" towards "H" in a clicking motion. Thus
              only the right legs reverse and the bug makes a turn. When "E" is
              driven in the normal direction, the centre of "F" drives the outer
              casing "F" via an action called an "Inclined Dog Clutch" and "F"
              drives "G" via a square shaft and "G" drives "H" and "J" is an
              eccentric pin to drive the legs. <br>
              The drawing of an Inclined Dog Clutch shows how the clutch drives in
              only one direction. In the reverse direction it rides up on the ramp
              and "clicks" once per revolution. The spring "G" in the photo keeps
              the two halves together. <br>

              </b>
              Here is a simpler circuit than
              MAKE TIME FLY from our first book of 100 transistor circuits. <br>
              For those who enjoy model railways, the ultimate is to have a fast
              clock to match the scale of the layout. This circuit will appear to "make time
              fly" by revolving the seconds hand once every 6 seconds. <br>
              Model Railway time is either 4 or 6 times faster so the clock-motor
              gets 4 pulses per second or 6 pulses per second instead of one pulse
              per second. <br>
              The timing
              can be adjusted by the electrolytics in the circuit. The electronics
              in the clock are disconnected from the coil and the circuit drives
              the coil directly. The circuit takes a lot more current than the
              original clock (1,000 times more) but this is the only way to do the
              job without a sophisticated chip.&nbsp;

              very fast to prevent both transistors coming on at the same time and

              This circuit toggles the LEDs each time it detects a
              clap or tap or short whistle. <br>
              The second 10u is charged via the 5k6 and 33k and when a sound is
              detected, the negative excursion of the waveform takes the positive
              end of the 10u towards the 0v rail. The negative end of the 10u will
              actually go below 0v and this will pull the two 1N4148 diodes so the
              anode ends will have near to zero volts on them.<br>
              As the voltage drops, the transistor in the bi-stable circuit that
              is turned on, will have 0.6v on the base while the transistor that
              is turned off, will have zero volts on the base. As the anodes of
              the two signal diode are brought lower, the transistor that is
              turned on, will begin to turn off and the other transistor will
              begin to turn on via its 100u and 47k. As it begins to turn on, the
              transistor that was originally turned on will get less "turn-on" from
              its 100u and 47k and thus the two switch over very quickly. The
              collector of the third transistor can be taken to a buffer
              transistor to operate a relay or other device. <br>

              <b> INTERCOM<br>
              </b>
              Here is a 2-station intercom using common 8R mini
              speakers. The "press-to-talk" switches should have a spring-return
              so the intercom can never be left ON.
              The secret to preventing instability (motor-boating) with a high
              gain circuit like this is to power the speaker from a separate power
              supply!&nbsp; You can connect an extra station (or two extra
              stations) to this design.<br>
              &nbsp;<img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/Intercom.gif"
                width="535" height="310" <br>
              Request from Kim Edwards:<br>
              Please analyse this circuit for me.<br>
              The circuit is not normal as it must consume no current when sitting
              around and either end must be able to call the other end. <br>
              Start with the first transistor. It is self-biased with about half
              rail voltage on the collector. The second transistor is self-biased
              with about 1v on the base (via the 220k and 1M). 0.4v across 470R
              makes about 1v across the 1k resistor. <br>
              The emitter of the BC557 will be about 0.4v lower than supply-rail.
              <br>
              This will produce about 1v p-p output via the speaker. <br>
              Increasing the 220k to 470k will increase the volume.&nbsp; The 10u
              to the speaker allows AC signal to enter the amplifier and the 10u
              on the supply-rail keeps the voltage from fluctuating too much as
              the supply is coming via the speaker. The 100u improves the current
              from the battery when the battery is weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

              These circuits produces a sinewave very nearly equal to
              rail voltage. <br>
              The important feature is the need for the emitter resistor and 10u
              /47u
              bypass electrolytic. It is a most-important feature of the circuit.
              It provides reliable start-up and guaranteed operation.
              For 6v operation, the 100k is reduced to 47k. <br>
              The three 10n capacitors and two 10k resistors (actually 3) determine the
              frequency of operation (700Hz).<br>
              The 100k and 10k base-bias resistors can be replaced with 2M2
              between base and collector. <br>
              This type of circuit can be designed to operate from about 10Hz to
              about 200kHz. <br>
              Both these circuits are NOT VERY RELIABLE. They work with some
              transistors better than others. They stop working when you touch
              some of the parts. The frequency changes when you add a 100u across
              the power rails. They are too fiddly to be recommended.&nbsp; Place
              a piezo diaphragm across the collector load and experiment&nbsp;
              yourself. Try changing the 1k and try 6v to 12v to see what I mean.

              The circuit
              produces high voltage pulses (spikes) of about 40v p-p (when the LED
              is not connected), at a frequency of 200kHz. The super-bright LED on
              the output absorbs the pulses and uses the energy to produce
              illumination. The voltage across the LED will be about 3.6v <br>
              The winding to the base is connected so that it turns the transistor
              ON harder until it is saturated. At this point the flux cannot
              increase any more and the transistor starts to turn off. The
              collapsing magnetic field in the transformer produces a very high
              voltage and that's why we say the transformer operates in FLYBACK
              mode. <br>
              This type of circuit will operate from 10kHz to a few MHz.

              A 25cm dia coil (consisting of 40 turns and 12 turns)
              is placed in the centre of a driveway (between two sheets of
              plastic). When a vehicle is driven over the coil, it responds by the
              waveform collapsing. This occurs because the tank circuit made up of
              the 40 turns is receiving just enough feedback signal from the 12
              turns to keep it oscillating. When metal is placed near the coil, it
              absorbs some of the electromagnetic waves and the amplitude
              decreases. This reduces the amplitude in the 12 turns and the
              oscillations collapses. The second transistor turns off and the 10k
              pulls the base of the third transistor (an emitter-follower) to the
              6v rail and turns on the LED.

              This project is called "mini"
              because its size is small and the output is small. <br>
              It uses
              <a href="http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/SurfaceMount/SurfaceMount-P1.html">
                surface mount</a> technology. <br>
              <br>
              <b><br>
                The output is push-pull and consumes less than 3mA (with no signal)
                but drives the earpiece to a very loud level when audio is detected.
                <br>
                The whole circuit is DC coupled and this makes it extremely
                difficult to set up. <br>
                Basically you don't know where to start with the biasing. The two
                most critical components are 8k2 between the emitter of the first
                transistor and 0v rail and the 470R resistor.<br>
                The 8k2 across the 47u sets the emitter voltage on the BC 547 and
                this turns it on. The collector is directly connected to the base of
                a BC 557, called the driver transistor. Both these transistors are
                now turned on and the output of the BC 557 causes current to flow
                through the 1k and 470R resistors so that the voltage developed
                across each resistor turns on the two output transistors. The end
                result is mid-rail voltage on the join of the two emitters. <br>
                The 8k2 feedback resistor provides major negative feedback while the
                330p prevents high-frequency oscillations occurring.

                  height="210" This circuit will operate a two-solenoid point-motor and prevent it overheating and
                  causing any damage. The circuit produces energy to change the points and ceases to provide any more
                  current.&nbsp; This is carried out by the switching arrangement within the circuit, by sampling the
                  output voltage. <br>
                If you want to control the points with a DPDT toggle switch or slide
                switch, you will need two CDU2 units. <br>
                <br>
                <b><br>
                  The circuit is supplied by 16v AC or DC and the diode on the input
                  is used to rectify the voltage if AC is supplied. If nothing is
                  connected to the output, the base of the BD679 is pulled high and
                  the emitter follows. This is called an emitter-follower stage. The
                  two 1,000u electrolytics charge and the indicator LED turns on. The
                  circuit is now ready. <br>
                  When the Main or Siding switch is pressed, the energy from the
                  electrolytics is passed to the point motor and the points change. As
                  the output voltage drops, the emitter-follower transistor is turned
                  off and when the switch is released, the electrolytics start to
                  charge again. <br>

                  Centre-Off toggle switch, providing the switch is returned to the
                  centre position after a few seconds so that the CDU unit can
                  charge-up.

              If your transformer does not supply 15vAC to 16vAC, you can increase
              the input voltage by adding a 100u to 220u electrolytic and 1N4004
              diode to the input to create a voltage doubling arrangement. You can
              also change one or both the 1,000u electrolytics for 2,200u. This
              will deliver a much larger pulse to the point-motor and guarantee
              operation.

              <b>VOLTAGE DOUBLER<br>
              </b>This is a voltage doubler
              circuit from a bicycle dynamo design found on the web. The dynamo produces 6v AC and charges
              a 3.3FARAD super cap via 2 diodes and an electrolytic. As you will
              see, C2, D3 and D4 are not needed and can be removed. <br>
              This is how the circuit works. <br>
              The voltage at the mid point of diodes D1 and D2 can fall to -0.6v
              and rise to rail voltage plus 0.6v without any current being
              supplied from the dynamo.<br>
              <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/VoltageDoubler.gif"
                width="368" height="332" When the voltage rises more than 0.6v above rail voltage, the dynamo needs to
                deliver current and this will allow the rail voltage to increase. We start with the dynamo producing
                negative from the left side and positive on the right side. <br>
              The left side will fall to -0.6v below the 0v rail and the right
              side will charge C1 and C2 will simply rise in exactly the same
              manner as we described the left side of the dynamo being able to
              rise. <br>
              Suppose C1 charges to about 7v (which it will be able to do after a
              few cycles). The voltage from the dynamo now reverses and the left
              side is positive and the right side is negative. The right side is
              already sitting at a potential of 7v (via C1) and as the left side
              increases, it raises the rail voltage higher by an amount that could
              be as high as 7v minus 0.6v. <br>
              The actual rail voltage will not be as high as this as the 3.3 Farad
              capacitor will be charging, but if energy is not taken from the
              circuit it will rise to nearly 14v or even higher according to the
              peak voltage delivered by the dynamo. <br>
              When the dynamo is delivering energy to the positive rail, it is
              "pushing down" on the C1 and some of its stored energy is also
              delivered. This means it will have a lower voltage across it when
              the next cycle comes around. C2, D3 and D4 are not needed and can be
              removed. In fact, C1 will always have rail voltage on it due to the
              47 resistor, so the voltage doubling will start as soon as the
              dynamo operates.

              quantity is CURRENT and TIME.&nbsp; You need to monitor the battery
              and determine when it is fully charged.

            This circuit is from an Interplak Model PB-12 electric toothbrush.<br>
            A coil in the charging base (always
            plugged in and on) couples to a mating coil in the hand unit to form
            a step down transformer. The MPSA44 transistor is used as an
            oscillator at about 60 kHz which results in much more efficient
            energy transfer via the air core coupling than if the system were
            run at 50 or 60Hz. The amplitude of the oscillations varies with the
            full wave rectified 100Hz or 120Hz unfiltered DC.

            The battery charger is nothing more than a diode to rectify the
            signal from the 120 turn coil in the charging base. Thus the battery is
            in
            constant trickle charge as long as the hand unit is in the base.
            The battery pack is a pair of 600mAhr AA NiCd cells.

            </b>
            This NiCd battery charger can charge up to 8 NiCd cells connected in
            series. This number can be increased if the power supply is
            increased by 1.65v for each additional cell. If the BD679 is mounted
            on a good heatsink, the input voltage can be increased to a maximum
            of 25v. The circuit does not discharge the battery if the charger is
            disconnected from the power supply.<br>
            Usually NiCd cells must be charged at the 14 hour rate. This is a
            charging current of 10% of the capacity of the cell for 14 hours. This applies to a nearly flat
            cell. For example, a 600 mAh cell is charged at 60mA for 14 hours.
            If the charging current is too high it will damage the cell. The level of
            charging current is controlled by the 1k pot from 0mA to 600mA. The
            BC557 is turned on when NiCd cells are connected with the right polarity.
            If you cannot obtain a BD679, replace it with any NPN medium
            power Darlington transistor having a minimum voltage of 30v and a
            current capability of
            2A. By lowering the value of the 1 ohm resistor to 0.5 ohm, the maximum output current can be increased to
            1A.<p class="center">

            This circuit will detect when the voltage of a 12v battery reaches a
            low level. This is to prevent deep-discharge or maybe to prevent a
            vehicle battery becoming discharged&nbsp; to a point where it will
            not start a vehicle. This circuit is different to anything
            previously presented. It has HYSTERESIS. Hysteresis is a feature
            where the upper and lower detection-points are separated by a gap.
            <br>
            Normally,&nbsp; the circuit will deactivate the relay when the
            voltage is 10v and when the load is removed. The battery voltage
            will rise slightly by as little as 50mV and turn the circuit ON
            again. This is called "Hunting." The off/on timing&nbsp;has been
            reduced by adding the 100u. But to prevent this totally from
            occurring, a 10R to 47R
            is placed in the emitter lead. The circuit will turn off at 10v but
            will not turn back on until 10.6v when a 33R is in the emitter. <br>
            The value of this resistor and the turn-on and turn-off voltages
            will also depend on the resistance of the relay.

            Normally a single transistor-stage produces a gain of about 100. <br>
            If you require a very high gain, two stages can be used. Two
            transistors can be connected&nbsp; connected in many ways and the

            form a single transistor with very high gain, called&nbsp;
            DARLINGTON TRANSISTOR.&nbsp; <br>

            These devices consist of two NPN or PNP transistors but the same
            result can be obtained by using a PNP/NPN pair. This is called a Sziklai pair.
            This arrangement will have to be created with two separate
            transistors. <br>
            The Darlington transistor can also be referred to as: <br>
            "Super Transistor, Super Alpha Pair, Sziklai pair,
            Complementary Pair,<br>
            Darlington transistors have a gain of 1,000 to 30,000. When the gain
            is 1,000:1 an input of 1mA will produce a current of 1 amp in the
            collector-emitter circuit. <br>
            The only disadvantage of a Darlington Transistor is the minimum
            voltage between collector-emitter when fully saturated. It is 0.6v
            to 1.5v depending on the current through the transistor. <br>
            A normal transistor has a collector-emitter voltage (when saturated)
            of 0.2v to 0.5v.&nbsp; The higher voltage means the transistor will
            heat up more and requires good heatsinking. In addition, a
            Darlington transistor needs 1.2v between base and emitter before it
            will turn on. A Sziklai pair only requires 0.6v for it to turn on.

                between +3 and +25 volts, depending on the computer. But many serial
                ports produce voltages of only +8v and -8V and the programmer circuit
                uses this to produce a voltage of about 13.5v to put the PIC chip
                into programming mode. This is the minimum voltage for the
                programmer to work. Any computers with a lower voltage cannot be

                <td>This circuit will drive
                  a 5watt CFL tube from an old CFL lamp from 6v or 12v. It makes a
                  very handy emergency light.<br>
                  The transformer is made by winding 500 turns for the
                  secondary.<br>
                  This consists of winding about 10 turns on top of each other before
                  advancing along the rod. The rod can be round or flat, from an old
                  AM radio. It is called a ferrite rod. The 500
                  turns have to be added before reaching the end and this means 100
                  turns has to take up 1/5th of the distance. This reduces the voltage
                  between the turns as the enamel will only withstand 100 volts. <br>
                  Before you start winding, use at least 3 layers of “sticky-tape” to
                  prevent the high voltage shorting to the rod. <br>
                  The size of the wire is not important and anything 0.25mm or thinner
                  will be suitable. After winding the secondary, the primary is 50
                  turns and the feedback is 10 turns. <br>
                  The primary can be 0.5mm wire and the feedback 0.25mm. <br>
                  Connect the transistor, components and tube and turn the circuit ON
                  very briefly. If the tube does not illuminate immediately, reverse
                  the wires to the feedback winding. <br>
                  The transistor must be 2N 3055 (or the plastic version, TIP 3055).
                  It will get warm when illuminating the lamp and needs to be
                  heatsinked. The lamp must not be removed as the circuit will
                  overload and damage the transistor. <br>
                  The circuit takes 250mA when driving a 5 watt CFL (or 18 watt
                  fluorescent tube) on 12v supply. The 1k base resistor can be reduced
                  to 820R and the brightness will increase slightly but the current
                  will increase to 500mA.<br>
                  The circuit is more-efficient on 6v. The 1k base resistor is reduced
                  to 220R and the transistor remains cool.</td>

            This project will give you a REAL SHOCK.
            It produces up to 160v and outputs this voltage for a very short
            period of time. <br>
            The components are taken from an old CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp)
            as the transistors are high voltage types and the 1u5 electro @400v
            can also be taken from the CFL as well as the ferrite core for the
            transformer. <br>
            The CFL has a 1.5mH choke with a DC resistance of 4 ohms. This
            resistance is too low for our circuit and the wire is removed and
            the core rewound with 50 turns for the feedback winding and 300
            turns of 0.1mm wire to produce a winding with a resistance of about
            10 ohms for the primary.<br>
            The oscillator is "flyback" design that produces spikes of about
            160v and these are fed to a high-speed diode (two 1N4148 diodes in
            series) to charge a 1u5 electrolytic to about 160v. If you put your
            fingers across the electrolytic you will hardly feel the voltage.
            You might get a very tiny tingle at the end of your fingers. <br>
            But if this voltage is delivered, then turned off, you get an
            enormous shock and you pull yours fingers off the touch pads. <br>
            That's what the other part of the circuit does. It turns on a
            high-voltage transistor for a very short period of time and this is
            what makes the circuit so effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

            <b>TELEPHONE AMPLIFIER</b><br>
            This amplifier circuit is used in all
            home telephones to amplify the signal from the line to the earpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The voltage is taken from the line via a bridge that delivers a
            positive rail, no matter how the phone wires are connected. <br>
            A 600 ohm to 600ohm standard telephone transformer is used to pick
            off a signal from the phone line and this is passed through
            capacitors and resistors to the input of the amplifier. Negative
            feedback is provided by a 15k and 1n2 capacitor. The operating point
            for the amplifier is set by the 100k pot and this serves to provide
            an effect on the gain of the amplifier and thus the volume.&nbsp;
            <br>
            This circuit is only connected to the line AFTER the phone has been
            "picked up." Once you "hang up" you must also disconnect this
            circuit from the phone line as it will "hang onto" the line due to
            the 12v zener and also due to the current it takes. <br>
            This is not an "automatic circuit" It must be connected and removed
            manually. <br>

            A Piezo Buzzer contains a transistor, coil, and piezo diaphragm and
            produces sound when a voltage is applied. The buzzer in the circuit
            above is a PIEZO BUZZER. <br>

            The circuit starts by the base receiving
            a small current from the 220k resistor. This produces a small
            magnetic flux in the inductor and after a very short period of time
            the current does not increase. This causes the magnetic flux to
            collapse and produce a voltage in the opposite direction that is
            higher than the applied voltage. <br>
            3 wires are soldered to pieces of metal on the top and bottom sides
            of a ceramic substrate that expands sideways when it sees a voltage.
            The voltage on the top surface is passed to the small electrode and
            this positive voltage is passed to the base to turn the transistor
            ON again.&nbsp; This time it is turned ON more and eventually the
            transistor is fully turned ON and the current through the inductor
            is not an INCREASING CURRENT by a STATIONARY CURRENT and once again
            the magnetic flux collapses and produces a very high voltage in the
            opposite direction. This voltage is passed to the piezo diaphragm
            and causes the electrode to "Dish" and produce the characteristic
            sound. At the same time a small amount is "picked-off" and sent to
            the transistor to create the next cycle.

              vibrations on a table. <br>
              The circuit does not have any section that determines the frequency.
              In the next circuit and all those that follow, the section that
              determines the frequency of operation is called the TUNED CIRCUIT or
              TANK CIRCUIT and consists of a coil and capacitor. This circuit does
              not have this feature. The transistor turns on via the 47k and this
              puts a pulse through the 15 turn winding. The magnetic flux from
              this winding passes through the 6 turn winding and into the base of
              the transistor via the 22n capacitor. This pulse is amplified by the
              transistor and the circuit is kept active. <br>
              The frequency is determined by the 6 turn coil. By moving the turns
              together, the frequency will decrease.&nbsp; The circuit transmits at
              90MHz. It has a very poor range and consumes 16mA.
              The coil is wound on a 3mm drill and uses 0.5mm wire.

            stability over the previous circuit. (In later circuits we will show
            how to improve stability. The main way to improve stability is to
            add a "buffer" stage. This separates the oscillator stage from the
            output.)&nbsp; <br>
            The antenna is connected to the <b>collector of the transistor</b>

            oscillator and this allows the gain of the microphone to be set via
            the 22k resistor. Lowering the resistor will make the microphone
            more sensitive. This circuit is the best you can get with one

              to a single turn. This effectively increases the current into the
              antenna. And that is exactly what we want.<br>
              The range is not as far but the stability is better. The frequency
              will not drift as much when the bug is held. As the tap is taken
              towards the collector, the output increase but the stability
              deceases.<p></p>

              2-TRANSISTOR CIRCUIT<br>
            </b>


            The next progressive
            step is to add a transistor to give the electret microphone more
            sensitivity. The electret microphone contains a Field Effect
            Transistor and you can consider it to be a stage of amplification.
            That's why the electret microphone has a very good output. <br>
            A further stage of amplification will give the bug extremely good
            sensitivity and you will be able to pick up the sound of a pin
            dropping on a wooden floor. <br>
            Many of the 1 transistor circuits over-drive the microphone and this
            will create a noise like bacon and eggs frying. The microphone's
            used by Talking Electronics require a load resistor of 47k for a 6v
            supply and 22k for a 3v supply. The voltage across the microphone is
            about 300mV to 600mV. <br>
            Only a very simple self-biasing common-emitter stage is needed. This
            will give a gain of approx 70 for a 3v supply. The circuit below
            shows this audio amplifier, added to the previous transmitter
            circuit. This circuit is the best design using 2 transistors on a 3v
            supply. The circuit takes about 7mA and produces a range of about
            200 - 400metres. <br>
            <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/FM/2-TrFMTx.gif" width="435"
              height="220" <br>
            Five points to note in the circuit above:<br>
            1. The tank circuit has a fixed 39p and is adjusted by a 2-10p
            trimmer. The coil is stretched to get the desired position on the
            band and the trimmer fine tunes the location. <br>
            2. The microphone coupling is a 22n ceramic. This value is
            sufficient as its capacitive reactance at 3-4kHz is about 4k and the
            input to the audio stage is fairly high, as noted by the 1M on the
            base. <br>
            3. The 1u between the audio stage and oscillator is needed as the
            base has a lower impedance as noted by the 47k base-bias resistor.
            <br>
            4. The 22n across the power rails is needed to keep the rails
            "tight." Its impedance at 100MHz is much less than one ohm and it
            improves the performance of the oscillator enormously.&nbsp; <br>
            5. The coil in the tank circuit is 5 turns of enameled wire with air
            core. The secret to long range is high activity in the oscillator
            stage. The tank circuit (made up of the coil and capacitors across
            it) will produce a voltage higher than the supply voltage due to the
            effect known as "collapsing magnetic field"&nbsp; and this occurs when
            the coil collapses and passes its reverse voltage to the capacitor.
            The antenna is also connected to this point and it receives this
            high waveform and passes the energy to the atmosphere as
            electromagnetic radiation. <br>
            When the circuit is tightly constructed on a PC board, the frequency
            will not drift very much if the antenna is touched. &nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>

            converted to RF. The main advantage of this design is being able to
            connect to a 9v battery. In a technical sense, about half the energy
            is wasted as the stages actually require about 4v - 5v for maximum

            This circuit can be used to automatically keep

            <br>
            The circuit below is the simplest design and consumes almost
            zero current when the tank is full. When the water is LOW, the
            circuit is turned ON via the 100k pot and 10k resistor.<br>
            When the water reaches the copper wire, the voltage on the base of
            the first transistor reduces and the current into the Darlington
            arrangement is too small to keep the relay energised and
            the motor turns OFF.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            As the water-level drops, the current into the Darlington pair
            increases and a point is reached when the relay pulls-in again.


            <br>

              width="310" height="390" <p>
            <br>
            This simple circuit will show the water level in a tank.<br>
            It has a HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW levels and as the water touches the
            pads, the LEDs start to illuminate. This produces a range of levels
            to let you know exactly the level of the water. <br>
            The sensor pads can be cut from a tin-can or you can use the lid of
            a tin. <br>
            The main sensor is placed at the bottom of the water so
            the low-level LED will let you know the tank is almost empty.
            </p>
            <p class="center">

              &nbsp;The circuit has been drawn to show the transistors are placed on the
              top of the tank with wires going to each of the sensor pads. The
              LEDs and resistors are mounted on a wall in your house with the 3v
              supply and a push-switch. <br>
              You will need a 4-wire connection between the two units and this can
              be 4-core telephone cable. <br>
              The transistors are wired as emitter-followers and this saves 4
              resistors (base-bias resistors). It also allows the LEDs to come on
              slowly as the water rises so you get a wide indication of the water
              level. <br>
              You can add more sensors if required. Simply repeat the circuit
              above for 3 more levels. <br>
              Any NPN transistor can be used and any value resistor between 100
              ohms and 330 ohms can be used and the voltage can be increased to 6v
              if you are using a high-value resistor. <br>
              The circuit only takes current when the switch is pressed but it can
              be left ON all the time to let you know the water level, if needed.
              <br>
              You don’t need a circuit board. Simply hammer a few nails into a
              length of wood to hold the sensors and connect the transistors to
              the nails by soldering. <br>
              Make sure the sensor pads are away form the wood and don’t hold any
              water when the level goes down as the circuit is so sensitive that
              the LEDs will not go out.

            <b>BATTERY CHARGER -
              world's simplest automatic charger</b><br>



            This is the world's simplest automatic battery
            charger. <br>
            It consists of 6 components, when connected to a 12v DC plug pack.
            The plug pack must produce more than 15v on no-load (which most plug
            packs do.) An alternative 15v transformer and a centre-tapped
            transformer is also shown. A centre-tapped transformer is referred
            to as: 15v-CT-15v&nbsp; or 15-0-15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            The relay and transistor are not critical as the 1k pot is adjusted
            so the relay drops-out at 13.7v. <br>
            To improve the "pull-in" and "drop-out" voltages, the 10k can be replaced with a 12v
            zener. The zener can be made up of two 6v zeners or any combination
            in series and include ordinary diodes (drop 0.6v).<br>
            The plug pack can be 300mA, 500mA or 1A and its current rating will
            depend on the size of the 12v battery you are charging. <br>
            For a 1.2AH gel cell, the charging current should be 100mA. However,
            this charger is designed to keep the battery topped-up and it will
            deliver current in such short bursts, that the charging current is
            not important. <br>
            This applies if you are keeping the battery connected while it is
            being used. In this case the charger will add to the output and
            deliver some current to the load while charging the battery. If you
            are charging a flat cell (flat 12v battery - a discharged 12v
            battery), the current should not be more than 100mA.
            <br>
            For a 7AH battery, the current can be 500mA. And for a larger
            battery, the current can be 1Amp.<br>

              width="540" height="200" <br>
            <b>Most 12v Plug Packs produce 15v to 16v on NO-LOAD and we are
              using this feature to charge the battery. We are also using the poor
              regulation of the plug pack to charge the battery without the plug
              pack overheating.&nbsp; </b><br>
            <b><br>
              SETTING UP</b><br>
            Connect the charger to a battery and place a digital meter across
            the battery. Adjust the 1k pot so the relay drops out as soon as the
            voltage rises to 13.7v. <br>
            Place a 100R 2watt resistor across the battery and watch the voltage
            drop. <br>
            The charger should turn on when the voltage drops to about 12.5v.
            This voltage is not extremely critical. It happens to be the
            "hysteresis" of the circuit and is determined by the value of the
            load in the collector of the transistor. <br>
            The 22u stops the relay "squealing" or "hunting" when a load is
            connected to the battery and the charger is charging. As the battery
            voltage rises, the charging current reduces and just before the
            relay drops out, it squeals as the voltage rises and falls due to
            the action of the relay. The 22u
            prevents this "chattering".
            <br>
            <b>To increase the Hysteresis</b>: In other words, decrease the
            voltage where the circuit cuts-in, add a 270R across the coil of the
            relay. This will increase the current required by the transistor to
            activate the relay and thus increase the gap between the two
            activation points. The pull-in point on the pot will be higher and
            you will have re-adjust the pot, but the drop-out point will be the
            same and thus the gap will be wider. <br>
            In our circuit, the cut-in voltage was 11.5v with a 270R across the
            relay.<br>
            <b>Note</b>: No diode is needed across the relay because the
            transistor is never fully turned off and no back EMF (spike) is
            produced by the relay. <br>
            <br>
            ATTERY
            CHARGER - trickle charger<br>
            </b>This circuit will
            automatically keep a battery fully charged with the charge-current
            reducing when the battery voltage reaches 13.8v. The battery can be
            used at any time and the charger will maintain full charge. <br>

              width="340" height="200" <br>
            The transistor acts like a POWER ZENER (with the 13.8v zener on the
            base) and the supply rail does not rise above 13.8v + 0.6v = 14.4v.
            The 1N4004 removes the 0.6v to deliver 13.8v to the battery. <br>
            If the plug pack is replaced with a supply capable of delivering a
            voltage higher than 16v (on no-load), the 3R3 (3watt) resistor will
            be needed.&nbsp; The transistor simply removes the charging current
            from the battery and wastes it as heat. <p></p>

              a very simple design to keep a battery "topped up."<br>

              This is a very simple battery
              charger to keep a battery "nearly fully charged." <br>
              It consists of 7 components, when connected to a 12v - 18v DC plug
              pack. The plug pack must produce more than 15v on no-load (which
              most 12v plug packs do.)<br>
              For a 1.2AH gel cell, up to a 45Ahr car or boat battery, this charger
              will keep the battery topped-up and can be connected for many months
              as the battery will not lose water due to "gassing." <br>
              The output voltage is 13.2v and this is just enough to keep the
              battery from discharging, but will take a very long time to charge a
              battery, if it is flat because a battery produces a "floating
              charge" of about 13.6v when it is being charged (at a
              reasonable current) and this charger is only designed to deliver a
              very small current. <br>
              There is a slight difference between a "old-fashioned" car battery
              (commonly called "an accumulator") and a sealed battery called a Gel
              Cell. The composition of the plates of a gel cell is such that the
              battery does not begin to "gas" until a high voltage is reached.
              That is why it can be totally closed and only has rubber bungs that
              "pop" if gas at high pressure develops due to gross over-charging.
              That's why the charging voltage must not be too high and when the
              battery is fully charged, the charging current must drop to a very
              low level.&nbsp; <p></p>

            This circuit uses an IC but it has been placed in this eBook as it
            is a transistor tester. <br>
            The circuit uses a single IC to perform 3 tests:<br>
            <b>Test 1</b>: Place the transistor in any orientation into the
            three terminals of circuit 1 (below, left) and a red LED will detect
            the base of a PNP transistor an a green LED will indicate the base
            of an NPN transistor. <br>
            <b>Test 2</b>: You now now the base lead and the type of transistor.
            Place the transistor in Test 2 circuit (top circuit) and when you
            have fitted the collector and emitter leads correctly (maybe have to
            swap leads), the red or green LED will come on to prove you have
            fitted the transistor correctly. <br>
            <b>Test 3</b>: The transistor can now be fitted in the GAIN SECTION.
            Select PNP or NPN and turn the pot until the LED illuminates. The
            value of gain is marked on the PCB that comes with the kit.&nbsp;
            The kit has ezy clips that clip onto the leads of the transistor to
            make it easy to use the project. <br>
            The project also has a probe at one end of the board that produces a
            square wave&nbsp; - suitable for all sorts of audio testing and some
            digital testing. <br>

            <b>LOW MAINS DROPOUT</b><br>
            This circuit will turn off a device if the main drops by a say 15v.
            The actual voltage is adjustable. The first thing to remember is
            this: The circuit detects the PEAK voltage and this is the voltage
            of the zener diodes. <br>
            For 240v mains, the peak is 338v. <br>
            For a voltage drop of about 12v(RMS), the zener diodes need to have
            a combined voltage of 320v (you will need 6 x 47v + 1 x 20v + 1 x
            18v). The 10k resistor will have about 18v across it and the current
            will be nearly 2mA. The wattage will be 36mW. <br>
            For a voltage drop of about 27v(RMS),&nbsp; you will need zeners for
            a total of 300v by using&nbsp; 6 x 47v + 1 x 18v. The voltage across
            the 10k resistor will be 38v and the current will be nearly 4mA. The
            wattage dissipated by the 10k resistor will be 150mW. <br>
            The 10u prevents very sharp dips or drops from activating the
            circuit. <br>
            As the voltage drops, this drop in voltage will be passed directly
            to the top of the 10k resistor and as the voltage drops, the current
            into the base of the transistor will reduce. This current is
            amplified by the transistor and when it is not sufficient to keep
            the relay activated, it will drop-out.&nbsp; <br>

            This circuit produces a very clean output. <br>

            This circuit has a number of features. The two transistors are
            directly coupled and this produces the maximum gain (or
            amplification). <br>
            The other feature is the use of a high impedance (resistance)
            speaker. A speaker is actually a LINEAR MOTOR and it gets its
            PULLING POWER from the AMP-TURNS provided by the coil. The amp-turns
            produce magnetic flux that pushes and pulls against the flux
            produced by the permanent magnet to move the cone. <br>
            You can get maximum amp-turns by having a coil with a small number
            of turns and requiring a high current. <br>
            Or the same number of amp-turns can be produced by having a coil
            with lots of turns and only needing to supply a very small current.
            That's what we have done. <br>
            You can get more volume, more loudness, with 8 ohm speaker, but when
            you have 1.5v supply, you will surprised how much volume you will
            get with 64 ohms.<br>
            BIASING<br>
            What happens with the two transistors?<br>
            The BC557 is turned ON via the 2M2 and the voltage on the base of
            the BC 557 drops lower than the supply of 1.5v by about 0.6v and
            this turns ON the BC547 and it is pulled towards the positive rail.&nbsp; This reduces the voltage across
            the 2M2 and
            initially it was 0.9v (1.5v - 0.6v). The BC557 finds it very hard to
            pull the BC547 transistor "up" because the load is the resistance of the speaker. This means the voltage
            across
            it will be very small when
            the circuit is "sitting around" (at rest) and has been measured at
            0.05mA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            This means the voltage across the speaker will be very small. <br>
            <br>
            Now we come to the operation of the circuit. <br>
            Suppose the input signal is able to fully turn ON the
            transistor-pair. <br>
            This means the amplitude will be from 0v to 1.5v - 0.6v
            = 0.9v&nbsp; That is just 0.9v swing. <br>
            When the circuit is working, the output of the transistor will be
            passed
            directly to the speaker.

            The secondary is 500 turns.&nbsp; These
            turns have to be added by winding the turns on top of each other and
            gradually advancing across the rod so you don't go back to the
            beginning-end again. The 500 turns have to be jumble-wound from one
            end to the other as the enamel will only withstand 100 volts. The
            wire can be 0.25mm or thinner. <br>
            Before you start winding, use at least 3 layers of “sticky-tape” to

              It is really an AC-coupled single-ended class A amp, with an open-loop gain of about 5,000,
              but as a demonstration-circuit, you can treat it as a simple op-amp.
              The output is biased at approximately one-half the supply voltage
              using the combined voltage drops across the two LEDs, the emitter-base voltage of
              the input transistor and the 1v drop across 1M feedback
              resistor. The 68k and 4n7 form a
              compensation network that prevents the circuit from oscillating.

            <div class="left">
              You can configure this op amp as an active filter or as an
              oscillator. It drives a load of 1kΩ. The square-wave response
              is good at 10kHz, and the output reduces by 3dB at 50kHz. </div>

            <b>10 SECOND DELAY<br>
            </b>This clever circuit turns on
            the LED 10 seconds after the power has been switched ON. The secret
            to its performance is the gain of the transistor. <br>
            With a gain of 200, the transistor will appear as a 470/200 = 2k3
            resistor for the LED and for a 12v supply, this will create a
            current of 12-1.7 / 2300 = 4.4mA through the LED. <br>
            The 100u will take about 10 seconds to charge to a point where the
            base is 1.7v + 0.6v = 2.3v above the 0v rail. When the electro
            charges to this voltage, the LED starts to come on. <br>
            The transistor effectively becomes a 2k3 resistor and that's why no
            additional current-limiting resistor for the LED is needed. The
            transistor is the current-limiting device!<p class="center">

                width="256" height="227" The PC board is 16mm x 14mm. <br>
              The secret to the circuit working is the "transformer." The ferrite
              is very short and the flux produced by the circuit is passed to the surroundings. <br>
              There are 6 wires but only 5 connections as the two middle wires are
              a LOOP. <br>
              The circuit is a BLOCKING OSCILLATOR and it turns off for a period
              of time and the 135t and 1n form an oscillator that produces the
              190kHz signal. During this time the radio produces silence and when
              the "carrier" is not produced the radio picks up background noise.
              <br>
              At the beginning, the circuit is turned ON by the 470k resistor.
              This causes current to flow in the primary winding and produces flux
              that cuts the turns on the feedback winding. This produces a
              positive voltage from the end of feedback winding that adds to the
              initial voltage and this converts to additional current into the
              base of the transistor to turn it ON more. This effect continues
              until the transistor is fully turned ON and at this point the flux
              in the core is a maximum but it is not increasing-flux and the
              voltage from the feedback winding immediately ceases. This
              immediately turns off the transistor and the flux collapses very
              quickly and it produces a very high voltage in the 3 windings. The
              reverse voltage from the feedback winding does bot go anywhere
              because of the diode and the voltage out the primary winding does
              not go anywhere because the transistor is effectively "out of
              circuit."<br>
              This only leaves the flux to cut the 135 turns and charge the 1n
              capacitor. It does this very quickly and when the voltage has been
              converted to a voltage to charge the capacitor, the capacitor turns
              around and supplies its voltage to the 135t to produce flux in the
              ferrite core in the opposite direction. This effect continues for a
              number of cycles and each time some of the energy is lost to the air
              via escaping flux. It eventually reduces to a point where the 3v
              supply will start to turn ON the transistor again to repeat the
              cycle. <br>

            FLASHING LIGHTS FOR MODEL RAILWAY CROSSING:<br>
            </b>A flashing LED is used to create the timing for the
            flash-rate and the transistor provides the alternate flash for the
            second set of LEDs. The first circuit comes off the web, but Colin
            Mitchell doesn't think it will work. See his circuit below. <b><br>

              width="343" height="575" <br>
            The top two 1k resistors are current-limiting resistors and can be
            increased if you want the LEDs to be dull. <br>
            The 2k2 makes sure the two LEDs are completely turned-off because
            the flashing LED draws a small current when it is off and this shows
            in the two LEDs. The lower 1k may need to be reduced to 470R to
            completely turn the transistor OFF. The other circuit does not have
            any of these features. The flashing LED has to be an ON-OFF flashing
            red OR green LED.&nbsp; Not a red-green flashing LED or a RED-GREEN-BLUE
            flashing LED. The flashing LED actually has an in-built resistor and
            will work on 2v to 5v. But we are using its feature of "taking a
            small current" when illuminated and then "taking almost zero
            current" when not illuminated, to "switch the transistor."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            You can get the CROSSING LIGHTS plastic mouldings from Talking
            Electronics. They will take 3mm LEDs. <br>
            Cost: $6.00 for 2 Crossing Lights with 4 LEDs and 2 metres of fine
            0.25mm enamelled wire. <br>
            You need to "push-out" the red lens and fit the 4 x 3mm red LEDs and
            carefully solder wires to the LEDs.

              REPLACING A "POWER POT":


              <br>

            </b>


            A <b>Power Potentiometer</b> (also called a rheostat) is a
            potentiometer with a rating of 1watt or more and these can be very
            expensive. A 10watt pot can cost as much as $25 to $35. <br>
            This type of pot can be replaced very cheaply by using an ordinary&nbsp;
            500R pot and a power transistor. <br>
            The power pot generally "burns out" when it is at least resistance
            and this circuit replaces the pot with one slight exception. <br>
            The circuit does not deliver full rail voltage. The output is about
            0.9v below rail voltage. A switch has been included to produce full
            rail output:<p class="center">

              <b>10 watt POWER POT</b>If the Power Pot is a rheostat, it will have two

              other terminal (the centre terminal - called the wiper) we will call
              "B," will go to the load. <br>
              Build the circuit above and take A and B to the same points as
              before and "G" goes to Ground or "earth" or "Chassis."

            DIODE TESTER<br>
            </b>All diodes are Zener diodes. For instance a 1N4148
            is a 120v zener diode as this is its reverse breakdown voltage. <br>
            And a zener diode can be used as an ordinary diode in a circuit with
            a voltage that is below the zener value. <br>
            For instance, 20v zener diodes can be used in a 12v power supply as
            the voltage never reaches 20v, and the zener characteristic is never
            reached. <br>
            Most diodes have a reverse breakdown voltage above 100v, while most
            zeners are below 70v. A 24v zener can be created by using two 12v
            zeners in series and a normal diode has a characteristic voltage of
            0.7v. This can be used to increase the voltage of a zener diode by
            0.7v. <br>
            To tests a zener diode you need a power supply about 10v higher than
            the zener of the diode. Connect the zener across the supply with a
            1k to 4k7 resistor and measure the voltage across the diode. If it
            measures less than 1v, reverse the zener. <br>
            If the reading is high or low in both directions, the zener is
            damaged. <br>
            Here is a zener diode tester. The circuit will test up to 56v
            zeners.

              POINT MOTOR DRIVER


              <br>
            </b>


            One of the first things (you will want) when expanding a model railway is&nbsp;a
            second loop or siding. <br>
            This needs a set of points and if they are distant from the
            operator, they will have to be electrically operated. There are a
            number of controllers on the market to change the points and some of them take a
            very high current. (You can get a low-current Point Motor).<br>
            The high current is needed because the actuating mechanism is very
            inefficient, but it must be applied for a very short
            period of time to prevent the point motor getting too hot. <br>
            Sometimes a normal switch is used to change the points and if the
            operator forgets use it correctly, the Point Motor will "burn-out" after a few seconds. <br>
            To prevent this from happening we have designed the following
            circuit. It operates the Point Motor for 5mS to 10mS (a very short
            time) and prevents any damage. <br>
            You can use a Peco switch (PL23 - about $10.00!!) or an ordinary
            toggle switch (change-over switch). <br>
            You can connect to either side of the Point Motor and both contacts
            of the other side go to 14v to 22v rail. <table id="table224" width="100" <tbody>

              HEADLIGHT EXTENDER <br>
            </b>
            This circuit extends the "ON TIME" for headlights and the circuit does
            not take any current when the time has expired.<br>
            When the headlights are switched OFF, the circuit keeps the lights
            ON for 30 seconds. <br>

            <br>
            The electronics needs 3 connections. The diagram above shows these
            connections. The first connection is to the 12v side of the battery. The
            output of the circuit is the emitter of the BD679 transistor and
            this connects to the relay where the wire from the headlight switch
            is connected. Finally the circuit connects to the chassis of the
            car. <br>
            The "delay-time" is determined by the 100u and 100k resistor. The
            resistor can be increased to 470k and the capacitor can be increased
            to 470u.&nbsp; For an adjustable time-delay, use a 500k mini trim
            pot for the 100k resistor.

              TURN INDICATOR ALARM

              <br>
            </b>


            Many turn indicators in cars, motor bikes and golf carts are not
            very loud. <br>
            That's why they get left ON.<br>
            Here are 2 circuits for you to experiment with and work out which is
            the best for your application. <br>
            They all use a piezo buzzer that has an oscillator circuit inside
            the case and produces a 3kHz annoying tone. We have listed two
            different types. TypeA produces a constant 3kHz tone that increases
            with loudness as the voltage increases. <br>
            TypeB is called a REVERSING BUZZER and produces a beep-beep-beep
            when a constant DC voltage is applied. The output increases in
            volume as the voltage increases. <br>
            <br>
            Circuit A turns on after 15 seconds to let you know the turn
            indicator is active. <br>
            You can use Piezo TypeA to get a beep when the turn light is ON and
            silence when the light is OFF. <br>
            Piezo typeB will produce a beep-beep-beep when the light is ON and
            silence when it is OFF.

              SOLAR CHARGER


              <br>
            </b>


            This is a simple circuit to
            keep a set of NiCads fully charged via a solar panel. <br>
            The mathematics and the circuit is the same for a 6v or 12v solar
            panel.<br>
            The mathematics revolves around CURRENT and not VOLTAGE.&nbsp; <br>
            Remember: NiCad cells are 1.2v and you will need 5 cells to produce
            a 6v supply.<br>
            Ni-MH cells are 1.2v and come in 1,700mAHr and 3,000mAHr (and other
            capacities).<br>
            You can recharge ordinary alkaline cells (1.5v) about 50 times. It
            has about the same capacity as NiCad after the second re-charge. <br>
            <b>1. MEASURE THE CURRENT TAKEN BY THE PROJECT</b><br>
            Firstly measure the current taken by the project. If it is a
            constant 10mA, you will need to charge the batteries with 40mA from
            the solar panel, if we assume the sun shines for 8 hours per day.
            <br>
            If the circuit takes 1amp for 1 hour, we need to charge the
            batteries with 150mA for 8 hours of sunshine. <br>
            If the circuit takes 500mA for 15 minutes each hour, this is
            equivalent to a constant 125mA and the charging will have to be
            500mA for 8 hours each day. (Even though this is equal to 3Ahr per
            day, the charging occupies 8 hours and thus the storage only needs
            to be 2Ahr and 2400mAHr cells can be used). <br>
            Our mathematics takes into account 80% efficiency in charging the
            cells. <br>
            If the NiCad cells are 600mAHr, the maximum charging current is
            100mA. <br>
            If the cells are 2,400mAHr, the maximum charging current is 500mA.<br>
            This charging current takes into account the fact that the cells
            will be fully charged towards the end of each day and that's why the
            current should not be too high. <br>
            <b>2. MEASURE THE CHARGING CURRENT</b><br>
            Build one of the circuits below and use a 100 ohm (1 watt) resistor
            for the current-limiting. <br>
            Connect a multimeter (select 0 - 500mA or 0 - 2Amp range) as shown
            and measure the current during the day. Take a few readings and work
            out and average current and approx the length of each day. <br>
            Every solar panel will deliver a different current and it is not
            possible to specify any values. That's why you have to take
            readings. If the current is too high, add another 100 ohm resistor
            in series. If the current is too low, place a 100 ohm resistor
            across the first 100 ohm resistor. <br>

            <b>WHITE NOISE GENERATOR:
              <br>
            </b>The basis of a white noise generator is the reverse connection
            of the base-emitter junction of a transistor as shown in fig A.<br>
            When the junction sees a voltage above about 5v, it breaks down and
            this causes the voltage to reduce. The junction ceases to break down
            and the condition repeats. The result is a waveform of a few
            millivolts to over 2v, depending on the value of the resistor
            supplying current to the junction. <br>
            This noise sounds like "ssssssssss" and can be added to an amplifier to produce all sorts of
            sound effects including Steam Sound for a model railway. <br>
            The waveform contains all amplitudes and frequencies from audible up
            to AM broadcast band. <br>
            Try the following circuits and see how they work. The supply must be over 5v and preferably more than
            8v. That's why many of the circuits specify 12v and higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              INTERCOM or TELEPHONE HANDSET<br>
            </b>


            You can make your own intercom or replace
            circuitry in old-style handsets with either of these circuits.<br>
            Telephone amplifier circuits are completely different to normal
            amplifier circuits. <br>
            For a start, they have very high negative feedback to prevent
            "whistle" and in telephone-speak the circuit is
            designed so sounds from the earpiece (receiver) are not picked
            up by the mouthpiece (microphone) and amplified to crate a whistle.
            <br>
            Secondly, the load for the amplifier is actually the relay at the
            exchange and the signal is picked off at the point where the
            amplifier connects to the relay and sent to the other telephone. <br>
            This means the supply for both the pre-amplifier and the output
            stage are on the same wire as the signal to the other
            phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            The voltage across the first circuit is generated by the 150k
            turning ON the first BC547 transistor and it "pulls-up" the second
            transistor (a partial emitter follower).<br>
            This creates current through the 150R and a voltage is developed
            across this resistor so that a voltage of approx 15v is developed
            across the whole circuit. <br>
            <br>

            <b>FRIDGE ALARM MkII</b><b><br>
            </b>
            This circuit drives an active piezo buzzer and the
            circuit takes <b>no current</b> when "sitting around."<br>
            It will start to produce a sound about 15 seconds after the Light
            Dependent Resistor detects light.<br>
            The mini piezo buzzer contains a transistor and inductor to produce
            a high amplitude oscillator to drive the diaphragm and produce a
            loud squeal from a supply of 3v to 5v. It will not "turn on" from a
            slowly rising voltage so the circuit must be designed to rise
            rapidly when light is detected. That's the purpose of the 2nd and
            3rd transistors. They form a high-gain amplifier where the output rises quickly
            due to the positive feedback provided by the 100n.<br>

            As soon as the second
            transistor starts to turn on, it turns on the 3rd transistor and the
            collector voltage rises. The right-plate of the 100n rises and since
            the 100n is uncharged, the left plate (lead) rises and increases the
            voltage and also the current into the base of the second transistor.
            This makes it turn on more and the action continues very quickly
            until both transistors are fully turned on. They stay turned on by
            the voltage (and current) provided by the first transistor.
            <br>
            Even though we normally see the second two transistors used as an
            oscillator, we can use the "rapid turn-on" feature to
            "kick-start" the piezo and if the middle
            transistor is provided with too-much voltage (current) on the base,
            the oscillator feature will not occur because the current into the
            base is too high and the 100n cannot remove this current during the
            turn-off period of the cycle. The only unusual feature of this
            circuit is the oscillator section starts to oscillate at very
            low amplitude when the first transistor turns off (when the LDR ceases to be
            illuminated) and a 10u has been added to stop this oscillation so
            it takes no current when at rest. <br>
            All the other designs (using a chip), take a small current when at
            rest and the worst circuit comes from <b>Future Kit</b>, a Thailand based kit company. You
            can see the discussion in <b>Spot The Mistake </b>Page 17 under

              The actual voltage can be adjusted by using LEDs and diodes in place of the
              zener. <br>

              The mini piezo buzzer contains a transistor and inductor to produce a high
              amplitude oscillator to drive the diaphragm and produce a loud squeal from a
              supply of 5v to about 10v. It will not "turn on" from a slowly rising
              voltage so the circuit must be designed to rise rapidly when the voltage
              drop down to the "detection-point."<br>
              That's the purpose of the 3rd and 4th transistors. They form a high-gain
              amplifier where the output rises quickly due to the positive feedback
              provided by the 100n.<br>
              As soon as the third transistor starts to turn on, it turns on the 4th
              transistor and the collector voltage rises. The right-plate of the 100n
              rises and since the 100n is uncharged, the left plate (lead) rises and
              increases the voltage and also the current into the base of the third
              transistor. This makes it turn on more and the action continues very quickly
              until both transistors are fully turned on. They stay turned on by the
              voltage (and current) provided by the first transistor.<br>
              Even though we normally see these two transistors used as an oscillator, we
              can use the "rapid turn-on" feature to "kick-start" the piezo and if the
              third transistor is provided with too-much voltage (current) on the base,
              the oscillator feature will not occur because the current into the base is
              too high and the 100n cannot remove this current during the turn-off period
              of the cycle. The only unusual feature of this circuit is the oscillator
              section starts to oscillate at very low amplitude when the second transistor
              turns off (when the battery voltage rises) and a 10u has been added to stop
              this oscillation so it takes no current when the buzzer is not producing a
              tone. The only stages that
              take any quiescent current are the zener and the 1M collector load resistor.

              This circuit will buzz when the voltage drops to a pre-set level.<br>
              To adjust the circuit, get as many 10,000u electrolytics as possible
              and use them in place of the Li-ion cell. <br>
              Charge the electrolytics with the Li-Ion cell and remove it. <br>
              The circuit takes a very
              amount of current and the voltage across the electrolytics will
              gradually drop. Monitor this with a digital meter and set the 100k
              pot to the required voltage.

              SIMPLE SONIC DETECTOR:
              <br>
            </b>This is a simple feedback
            circuit that produces a whistle called a FEEDBACK WHISTLE. <br>
            This terrible sound was very common in old amplifiers when the
            microphone was placed too near the speaker. <br>
            All you need is a high-gain amplifier and a microphone. We have used
            a piezo diaphragm for both the microphone and speaker. <br>
            The circuit works best on 12v but will produce good results on 6v or
            9v. <br>
            Vary the distance between the two piezos and turn one over and lift
            it off the bench to see the different effects and range. Move your
            hand closer to the piezos and see how the frequency changes. This is
            due to the length of the wave and if you are located at a distance
            where the wave does not add to the vibration of the receiving
            diaphragm, you get silence. <br>

            <p>The original reed switch can be used but the
              bottom connection to the board must be isolated and re-wired.<br>
              The reed switch cannot be de-soldered as it will fall apart. Change the
              value of the 4u7 electrolytic to increase the time.&nbsp; Closing
              the switch (in the circuit diagram above) operates the alarm. <br>
              When the voltage between the middle terminal of the slide switch and
              the lower terminal is reduced to 0v, the circuit operates.&nbsp; A
              very small current comes from the COB module via the middle pin of
              the slide switch and this current charges the 4u7 to 4.5v and the
              circuit turns OFF. <br>
              At the same time the two 22u are fully discharged. <br>
              When the switch is closed, the 4u7 is discharged via the two 22u
              electrolytics and the alarm is activated. If the switch is
              immediately released, the 4u7 takes time to charge via the COB
              module. <br>
              If the switch is kept closed, the COB module charges the 4u7 and the
              22u electrolytics and eventually turns OFF. If the switch is now
              opened, the 22u electrolytics discharge via the 1M. <br>
              This takes a considerable time and the alarm cannot be re-activated
              for a few seconds.

              240v INVERTER </b>


            <br>
            You will find lots of inverter circuits on the web, with the
            following arrangement of 2 transistors and a transformer. <br>
            <img src="https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/images101-200/Inverter-1.gif" width="450"

                width="449" height="374" </a><br>


              <p class="left">The problem is the circuit will oscillate at a very
                high frequency and the laminations in the transformer are only
                designed for a frequency of about 100Hz. <br>
                The transformer will be very inefficient and thus the circuit will
                be very inefficient. <br>
                The circuit should have capacitors to reduce the frequency to a
                suitable value. <br>
                I would not build this type of circuit. <b>

                Circuit Symbols<br>
              </span></b>The list below covers
            almost every symbol you will find on an electronic circuit diagram.
            It allows you to identify a symbol and also draw circuits. It is a
            handy reference and has some symbols that have never had a symbol
            before, such as a Flashing LED and electroluminescence panel.<br>
            Once you have identified a symbol on a diagram you will need to
            refer to specification sheets to identify each lead on the actual
            component.<br>
            The symbol does not identify the actual pins on the device. It only
            shows the component in the circuit and how it is wired to the other
            components, such as input line, output, drive lines etc. You cannot
            relate the shape or size of the symbol with the component you have
            in your hand or on the circuit-board. &nbsp;<br>
            Sometimes a component is drawn with each pin in the same place as on
            the chip etc. But this is rarely the case.<br>
            Most often there is no relationship between the position of the
            lines on the circuit and the pins on the component.<br>
            <br>
            That’s what makes reading a circuit so difficult.<br>
            <br>
            This is very important to remember with transistors, voltage
            regulators, chips and so many othe r components as the position of
            the pins on the symbol are not in the same places as the pins or
            leads on the component and sometimes the pins have different
            functions according to the manufacturer.&nbsp; Sometimes the pin
            numbering is different according to the component, such as positive
            and negative regulators.<br>
            These are all things you have to be aware of. <br>
            <br>
            You must to refer to the manufacturer’s specification sheet to
            identify each pin, to be sure you have identified them correctly.<br>

                The following list covers just a few of the IC's on the
                market and these are the "simple" or "basic" or
                "digital" or "op-amp" IC's suitable for experimenting.
                <br>
                When designing a circuit around an IC, you have to remember
                two things: <br>
                1. Is the IC still available? and <br>
                2. Can the circuit be designed around a microcontroller?<br>
                Sometimes a circuit using say 3 or 4 IC's can be re-designed
                around an 8-pin or 16-pin microcontroller and the program can be be
                kept from prying eyes due to a feature called "code
                protection." A microcontroller project is more
                up-to-date, can be cheaper and can be re-programmed to alter
                the features. <br>
                This will be covered in the next eBook. It is worth
                remembering - as it is the way of the future.
